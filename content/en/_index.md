# Discover The Early Writings Of The Church

Welcome to this collaborative project that provides easily accessible writings of the early church. We aim to provide resources that will be useful for students, scholars, and laypeople.

We believe that studying the [apostolic fathers](/apostolic-fathers/) as well as the rest of the early church writings is essential for understanding the development of Christianity. Their writings are a treasure trove of wisdom and insight, and we are committed to making them accessible to as many people as possible.

You will also find the [entire bible](/bible/) with a short description of each book and a video overview by the Bible Project. When the bible is quoted within a letter, we link and highlight directly to it to help you get more insights. Finally, when available, we provide the audio version for people who would like to listen to the writings of the early church.

We hope that you will find ChristianWritings.com a valuable resource in your faith journey. Thank you for visiting us, and may God bless you in your studies.
