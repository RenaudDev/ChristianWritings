## Who Was St. Ignatius of Antioch?
**Ignatius of Antioch** also known as Ignatius Theophorus meaning "the God-bearing"), was an early Christian writer and Patriarch of Antioch. While en route to Rome, where he met his martyrdom, Ignatius wrote a series of letters. This correspondence now forms a central part of a later collection of works known to be authored by the Apostolic Fathers. He is considered to be one of the three most important of these, together with [Clement of Rome](/clement-of-rome) and [Polycarp Of Smyrna](/polycarp-of-smyrna). His letters also serve as an example of early Christian theology. Important topics they address include ecclesiology, the sacraments, and the role of bishops.
