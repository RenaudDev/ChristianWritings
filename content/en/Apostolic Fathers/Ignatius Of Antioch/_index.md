# St. Ignatius of Antioch
*Saint Ignatius* was born in Syria in AD 35, and his arrest and execution occurred during the reign of Emperor Trajan (98-117). He is known mainly for his seven highly regarded letters during his trip to Rome. He is considered to be one of the three most important of these, together with [Clement of Rome](/apostolic-fathers/clement-of-rome/) and [Polycarp Of Smyrna](/apostolic-fathers/polycarp-of-smyrna/). 

The letters of Ignatius provide a valuable look into the early days of Christianity and offer insight into the challenges that the faith faced at that time. Saint Ignatius was a strong advocate for unity among Christians, and his letters are filled with exhortations to maintain peace and concord. He also warned against false doctrines and teachers and urged people to respect the bishop.

## Benefits of Reading the Writings of St. Ignatius

There are many benefits to reading about the life of martyrs like Saint Ignatius. They remind us that martyrdom is the supreme witness to the truth of the faith. It is an act of witness that can only be carried out by someone wholly committed to the Christian faith. A martyr is someone willing to die for their faith, and their death is a testimony to the truth of the gospel. In his letter to the Romans, that Ignatius points out being martyred for Christ is not about dying as a testimony to the truth but as the way to eternal life.

> Pardon me, brethren: do not hinder me from living, do not wish to keep me in a state of death; and while I desire to belong to God, do not give me over to the world. - [Epistle To The Romans](/apostolic-fathers/ignatius-of-antioch/romans/#6-by-death-i-shall-attain-true-life)

Enjoying reading and learning from St. Ignatius. It is time well spent.
