# Who Was Hermis of Philopopolis?

Hermis of Philopopolis is believed to be one of the 70 disciples of Jesus Christ. He was also the Bishop of Philippopoulos. He is mentioned in the New Testament in [Romans 16:14](/bible/romans/rom-16/#:~:text=Greet%20Asyncritus%2C%20Phlegon%2C%20Hermes%2C%20Patrobas%2C%20Hermas%2C%20and%20the%20brothers%20who%20are%20with%20them.). He is traditionally said to have been the author of the work known as the Shepherd of Hermas. The shepherd of Hermus was very popular among early Christians and was even considered as part of the biblical canon by some of the [early church fathers](/apostolic-fathers/). The shepherd of Hermus tells a vision seen by Hermis and was ultimately rejected as canon, as some saw the shepherd of Hermes saying that Jesus Christ was only adopted as the Son of God. However, this is still debated by theologians.
