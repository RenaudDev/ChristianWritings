# St. Polycarp of Smyrna

Have you ever wished that you could have been a disciple of one of the apostles? That is what **Polycarp** was able to do. As a disciple of Saint John the Evangelist, he was able to sit at the feet of the apostles and hear their stories first-hand. He also had the privilege of walking with those who had walked with Jesus himself. 

**Polycarp** AD 69 – 155 was a Christian bishop of Smyrna. In "[The Martyrdom of Polycarp](/apostolic-fathers/polycarp-of-smyrna/martyrdom/)", we learn that he died a martyr at the age of 86, bound and burned at the stake, then stabbed when the fire failed to consume his body. Polycarp is also known for his [Letter to the Philippians](/apostolic-fathers/polycarp-of-smyrna/philippians/) where he quotes the scriptures over 90 times in a very short letter. 

Polycarp of Smyrna is regarded as a saint and Church Father in the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglican, and Lutheran churches. Polycarp is regarded as one of three chief [Apostolic Fathers](/apostolic-fathers/), along with [Clement of Rome](/apostolic-fathers/clement-of-rome/) and [Ignatius Of Antioch](/apostolic-fathers/ignatius-of-antioch/).
