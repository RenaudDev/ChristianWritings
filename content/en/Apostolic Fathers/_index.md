The Ante-Nicene Fathers, also known as the **Apostolic Fathers** are a group of early Christian figures and anonymous writings who lived from the 1st to 2nd centuries AD.  They are considered important since they are writers who most likely had direct contact with Jesus and/or the Twelve Apostles. Although their writings are not included in the [New Testament](/tags/new-testament/), they are considered vital to understand the development of Christianity, it's earliest practices and beliefs.
