The most important writings of the apostolic era is of course, the [New Testament](/tags/new-testament/) scriptures. These writings were clearly considered authoritative by the successor to the apostles and continue to be held in high regard by Christians today.  However, there are other *early Christian writings* that also hold great value. 

The **Apostolic Fathers** were some of the most influential theologians in the early church. They lived in the 1st to 2nd century AD, and their writings are still studied and admired today. They are considered important since they are writers who most likely had direct contact with Jesus and/or the Twelve Apostles. Although their writings are not included in the New Testament, they are considered vital to understanding the development of Christianity, its earliest practices and beliefs. They wrote a variety of texts, including letters, treatises, and homilies. Some of the most important writings of the apostolic era are included in the collection you will find at the bottom of this page.
