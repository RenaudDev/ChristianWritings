# Miscellaneous Writings Of The Early Church

Welcome to our collection of miscellaneous writings. Here are early church writings that cannot be attributed to a particular author and yet, this doesn't mean that they are not important! In fact, they were kept by the church for how they give us insights on how the early thought about Scripture, one another and the world that surrounded them. We have much to benefit from reading these writings.
