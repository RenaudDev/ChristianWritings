# St. Melito Of Sardis

{{< youtube mMMB9Z6HFjg >}}

*St. Melito* was born around 100 AD, was the Bishop of Sardis, contemporary of [St. Polycarp](/apostolic-fathers/polycarp-of-smyrna/) and an [Apostolic Father](/apostolic-fathers/). 

A letter of Polycrates of Ephesus to Pope Victor states:

> "Melito the eunuch (or virgin), whose whole walk was in the Holy Spirit", was interred at Sardis, and had been one of the great authorities in the Church of Asia who held the [Quartodeciman theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartodecimanism). 

His name is also cited also in the "Labyrinth" of Hippolytus as one of the second-century writers who taught the duality of natures in Jesus. St. Jerome, speaking of the canon of Melito, quotes Tertullian's statement that he was esteemed a prophet by many of the faithful.

The only thing we have of him today is the writing found in 1940 called "On Pascha" (Peri tou pascha). It is a poetic sermon that interprets the Passover found in [The Book Of Exodus](/bible/exodus/) in the light of the Passion narrative found in the [New Testament](/tags/new-testament/).
