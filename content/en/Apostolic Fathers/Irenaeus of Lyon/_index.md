# St. Irenaeus of Lyon

{{< youtube danIMbc_xA8 >}}

St. Irenaeus, bishop of Lyon, is best known for his work in developing Christian theology and battling heresies. He was one of the first great Christian theologians, with his most significant work being "Against Heresies," which is considered a cornerstone of Christian orthodoxy.

Born in Smyrna (now Izmir, Turkey), Irenaeus was a disciple of St. Polycarp, who was a student of St. John the Apostle. He later moved to Gaul, where he became the bishop of Lugdunum (now Lyon, France).

Throughout his life, Irenaeus worked tirelessly against Gnosticism, a prevalent heresy of the time that claimed salvation came through secret knowledge. He emphasized the importance of the apostolic tradition and stressed the necessity of unity in the church.

## Irenaeus' Influence and Legacy

Towards the end of the second century, Irenaeus was instrumental in settling the Quartodeciman Controversy, which involved a dispute about the correct date to celebrate Easter.

Irenaeus played a key role in establishing the canonical gospels. His advocacy for the four gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John greatly influenced their acceptance in the Church.

Irenaeus passed away around 202 AD, leaving behind a legacy of theological insight that has continued to influence Christian thought. His work provides a vital link between the apostolic era and the later Church Fathers.
