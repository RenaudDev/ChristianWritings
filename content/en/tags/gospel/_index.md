The New Testament contains four ancient biographies of Jesus of Nazareth, and altogether they are called “the Gospel.” They are a part of the [New Testament Writings](/tags/new-testament/) in the [Bible](/bible/). Each one tells the story as an announcement of good news that the crucified, risen and ascended Jesus is the true ruler of the nations.
