# Book Of Joel
Book of Joel, second of 12 [Old Testament](/tags/old-testament/) books that bear the names of the [Minor Prophets](/tags/minor-prophet/). The Jewish canon lumps all together as The Twelve and divides Joel into four chapters; Christian versions combine chapters 2 and 3.

The book relates nothing about Joel except his name and that of his father. An analysis of the text further indicates that Joel lived during the period of the Second Temple of Jerusalem (516 BCâ€“AD 70), for his book reflects the liturgy then in use.
