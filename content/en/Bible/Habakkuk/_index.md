# Book Of Habakkuk
The Book of Habakkuk, also called The Prophecy Of Habacuc, the eighth of 12 [Old Testament](/tags/old-testament/) books that bear the names of the [Minor Prophets](/tags/minor-prophet/). The book betrays the influence of liturgical forms, suggesting that either Habakkuk was a cult prophet or that those responsible for the final form of the book were cult personnel.
