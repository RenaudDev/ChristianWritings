# Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle

The Second Letter of Peter is principally concerned with the Second Coming of Christ. The author attributes the apparent delay to Godâ€™s patience in allowing time for universal redemption and notes that in the sight of God 1,000 years are like one day. The writer also warns against false teachers, whose conduct is as immoral as their words are deceptive.  [ [Source](https://www.britannica.com/topic/letters-of-Peter)]
