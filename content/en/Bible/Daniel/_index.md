# Book Of Daniel
The Book of Daniel, also called The Prophecy Of Daniel, a book of the [Old Testament](/tags/old-testament/) found in the 'Ketuvim' (Writings), the third section of the Jewish canon, but placed among the Prophets in the Christian canon. The first half of the book (chapters 1–6) contains stories in the third person about the experiences of Daniel and his friends under Kings Nebuchadrezzar II, Belshazzar, Darius I, and Cyrus II; the second half, written mostly in the first person, contains reports of Daniel’s three visions (and one dream). The second half of the book names as author a certain Daniel who, according to chapter 1, was exiled to Babylon. [ [Source](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Book-of-Daniel-Old-Testament)]
