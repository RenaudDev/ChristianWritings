# Book Of Zephaniah
Book of Zephaniah, also called Sophonias, the ninth of 12 [Old Testament](/tags/old-testament/) books that bear the names of the [Minor Prophets](/tags/minor-prophet/), collected in one book, The Twelve, in the Jewish canon. The dominant theme of the book is the “day of the Lord,” which the prophet sees approaching as a consequence of the sins of Judah. A remnant will be saved (the “humble and lowly”) through purification by judgment. It is not clear whether the day of judgment is conceived of as historical or eschatological.[ [Source](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Book-of-Zephaniah)]
