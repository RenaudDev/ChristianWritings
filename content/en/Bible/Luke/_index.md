# Gospel According To Luke

Gospel According to Luke, third of the four [New Testament](/tags/new-testament/) Gospels (narratives recounting the life and death of Jesus Christ) and, with The Gospels According to Matthew and Mark, one of the three so-called [Synoptic Gospels](/tags/synoptic-gospel/). It is traditionally credited to St. Luke, “the beloved physician” (Col. 4:14), a close associate of the St. Paul the Apostle. Luke’s Gospel is clearly written for Gentile converts: it traces Christ’s genealogy, for example, back to Adam, the “father” of the human race rather than to Abraham, the father of the Jewish people.
