# Book Of Jonah
Book of Jonah, also spelled Jonas, the fifth of 12 [Old Testament](/tags/old-testament/) books that bear the names of the [Minor Prophets](/tags/minor-prophet/), embraced in a single book, The Twelve, in the Jewish canon. Unlike other Old Testament prophetic books, Jonah is not a collection of the prophet’s oracles but primarily a narrative about the man.

Jonah is portrayed as a recalcitrant prophet who flees from God’s summons to prophesy against the wickedness of the city of Nineveh. [ [Source](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Book-of-Jonah)]
