# Book Of Jeremiah
The Book of Jeremiah, also called The Prophecy Of Jeremias, one of the major prophetical writings of the [Old Testament](/tags/old-testament/). Jeremiah, a Judaean prophet whose activity spanned four of the most tumultuous decades in his countryâ€™s history, appears to have received his call to be a prophet in the 13th year of the reign of King Josiah (627/626 BC) and continued his ministry until after the siege and capture of Jerusalem by the Babylonians in 586 BC. Many of his oracles concerned the turbulent events of his times. [ [Source](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Book-of-Jeremiah)]
