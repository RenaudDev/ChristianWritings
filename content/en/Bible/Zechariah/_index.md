# Book Of Zechariah
Book of Zechariah, also spelled Zacharias, the 11th of 12 [Old Testament](/tags/old-testament/) books that bear the names of the [Minor Prophets](/tags/minor-prophet/), collected in the Jewish canon in one book, The Twelve. Only chapters 1–8 contain the prophecies of Zechariah; chapters 9–14 must be attributed to at least two other, unknown authors. Scholars thus refer to a “second” and “third” Zechariah: Deutero-Zechariah (chapters 9–11) and Trito-Zechariah (chapters 12–14). According to dates mentioned in chapters 1–8, Zechariah was active from 520 to 518 BC. [ [Source](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Book-of-Zechariah)]
