# Book of Leviticus

The book of Leviticus is the third book of the Torah (the Pentateuch) and of the Old Testament, also known as the Third Book of Moses. Throughout Leviticus, Israel remains encamped at Mount Sinai while God appears in the Tent of Meeting, dictating to Moses his specifications regarding the Jewish ceremonial laws. The laws are extremely detailed, outlining every aspect of how and when religious offerings are to be presented to God.
