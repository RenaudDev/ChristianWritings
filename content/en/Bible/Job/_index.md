# Book of Job

This story concerns Job, a prosperous man of outstanding piety. Satan acts as an agent provocateur to test whether or not Job's piety is rooted merely in his prosperity. But faced with the appalling loss of his possessions, his children, and finally his own health, Job still refuses to curse God. [ [Source](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Book-of-Job)]
