# First Epistles of St. Paul the Apostle to Timothy

Letters of Paul to Timothy, also called Epistles of St. Paul the Apostle to Timothy, abbreviation Timothy, either of two New Testament writings addressed to St. Timothy, one of St. Paul the Apostleâ€™s most faithful coworkers. The First Letter of Paul to Timothy and the Second Letter of Paul to Timothy are the 15th and 16th books of the New Testament canon. Together with the Letter of Paul to Titus, they have been called Pastoral Epistles since the end of the 18th century, because all three deal principally with church administration and the growth of heresies and were addressed to individuals rather than congregations.
