# Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle

The second and third letters are closely akin to the first in language and ideas. The Second Letter of John exhorts a church, fancifully called “the elect lady and her children,” to boycott the docetic heretics (combated in 1 John), who deny the reality of the Incarnation. In 2 John, as in the Gospel According to John and 1 John, the light–darkness images are similar to those of the Dead Sea Scrolls. To “walk in the truth” is to reject heresy and follow the doctrine of Christ.   [ [Source](https://www.britannica.com/topic/letters-of-John)]
