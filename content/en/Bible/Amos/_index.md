# Book Of Amos
Book of Amos, the third of 12 [Old Testament](/tags/old-testament/) books that bear the names of the [Minor Prophets](/tags/minor-prophet/), collected in one book under the Jewish canon titled The Twelve. Amos, a Judaean prophet from the village of Tekoa, was active in the northern kingdom of Israel during the reign of Jeroboam II (c. 786â€“746 BC). According to 7:14, Amos was neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet; i.e., he was not a member of a professional prophetic guild. [ [Source](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Book-of-Amos)]
