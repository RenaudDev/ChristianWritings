# Gospel According To Matthew

Gospel According to Matthew, first of the four [New Testament](/tags/new-testament/) Gospels (narratives recounting the life and death of Jesus Christ) and, with The Gospels According to Mark and Luke, one of the three so-called [Synoptic Gospels](/tags/synoptic-gospel/). The Gospel According to Matthew consequently emphasizes Christâ€™s fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies (5:17) and his role as a new lawgiver whose divine mission was confirmed by repeated miracles.
