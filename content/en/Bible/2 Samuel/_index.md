# Book of 2 Samuel

The book of 2 Samuel continues to show us the virtue of humility, the destructiveness of pride, and the faithfulness of God's promise. We see David succeed and fail, and we see God's promise for a future king at the beginning and end of the story. [ [Source](https://bibleproject.com/explore/video/2-samuel/)]
