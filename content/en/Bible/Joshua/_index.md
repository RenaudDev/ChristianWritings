# Book of Joshua

Joshua leads Israel to settle in the promised land. The book of Joshua shows us God's faithfulness to his covenant with the Israelites to bring them into the land he promised to Abraham. This book points to the importance of covenant obedience before, during, and after God fulfills his promises. [ [Source](https://bibleproject.com/blog/judgement-cruelty-conquering-promised-land/)]
