Stoicism is a philosophy that has been around for over 2,000 years, yet its ideas continue to influence modern thought and culture. The philosophy was founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC and is centered around the idea that the key to a happy life is to live in harmony with nature and to cultivate a sense of inner peace and contentment.

The Stoics believed that the universe was governed by reason and that human beings should strive to live in accordance with this reason. They emphasized the importance of virtue, self-control, and rationality, and believed that these qualities were essential to achieving inner tranquility and contentment.

Stoicism has had a profound impact on Western thought, influencing the likes of Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius. It has also experienced a resurgence in popularity in recent years, with many people turning to Stoicism as a way to find meaning and purpose in their lives.
