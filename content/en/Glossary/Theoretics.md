Theoretics is a branch of philosophy that examines and evaluates the fundamental principles and concepts of reality, knowledge, and values. It is a holistic approach to understanding the world around us and the forces that shape it. Theoretics seeks to explain the universe in terms of its fundamental laws and principles, and to uncover the underlying causes and motivations behind human behavior. By exploring the structure of the universe and the relationships between individuals, societies, and civilizations, theoretics provides us with an understanding of our place in the world, as well as a framework for understanding the ethical implications of our decisions and actions. Through the application of the theoretics, we can gain a deeper understanding of the world and the people around us, leading to a greater appreciation of the richness and complexity of life.

Some of the most influential people to read in order to learn more about theoretics include Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Kant, Hume, and Russell. Each of these thinkers have made important contributions to the field and have provided valuable insights into the structure of the universe and the principles that govern it. Additionally, modern theoreticians such as Richard Dawkins and Stephen Hawking have made significant contributions to the field and have helped to shape our understanding of the universe.
