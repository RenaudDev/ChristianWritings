The Peripatetics were a school of philosophy in ancient Greece founded by Aristotle, one of the most influential philosophers in Western thought. The name "Peripatetic" comes from the Greek word "peripatos," which means "to walk around." It is said that Aristotle would walk around the Lyceum in Athens while teaching his students, which led to the name.

The Peripatetics were known for their emphasis on the study of nature and the natural world, and Aristotle's works on biology, zoology, and metaphysics continue to be studied today. They also believed in the importance of living a virtuous life and saw ethics as an essential component of philosophy.

After Aristotle's death, the Peripatetic school continued to thrive under the leadership of his followers, such as Theophrastus and Strato of Lampsacus. The school eventually declined in influence, but its ideas and teachings continued to have an impact on later philosophers and thinkers.

Today, the term "Peripatetic" is sometimes used more broadly to refer to anyone who engages in philosophical discussion while walking around, or anyone who has a wandering or itinerant lifestyle.
