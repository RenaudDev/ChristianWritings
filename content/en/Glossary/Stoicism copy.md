Platonism is a philosophy that was founded by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato over 2,000 years ago. The philosophy is centered around the idea that there is an objective reality that exists beyond our sensory perception, and that this reality can be accessed through reason and contemplation.

Platonism is known for its emphasis on the concept of the Forms or Ideas, which are believed to be the true essence of things. According to Plato, the physical world that we see around us is merely a shadow or copy of the real world of Forms. For example, the physical apple that we see and taste is just a manifestation of the ideal Form of the apple, which exists in the world of Forms.

Another key concept in Platonism is the idea of the immortality of the soul. Plato believed that the soul is immortal and exists prior to and after the physical body. He also believed that the soul is capable of understanding the world of Forms and that this understanding is essential to achieving true knowledge and wisdom.

Platonism has had a profound influence on Western philosophy and thought, and its ideas continue to be studied and debated today.
