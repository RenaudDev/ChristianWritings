The height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.\nv17 There were nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.\nv18 So he made the pillars; and there were two rows around on the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars: and he did so for the other capital.\nv19 The capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily work, four cubits.\nv20 There were capitals above also on the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network. There were two hundred pomegranates in rows around the other capital.\nv21 He set up the pillars at the porch of the temple. He set up the right pillar, and called its name Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called its name Boaz.\nv22 On the top of the pillars was lily work: so the work of the pillars was finished.\nv23 He made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in shape. Its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it.\nv24 Under its brim around there were buds which encircled it for ten cubits, encircling the sea. The buds were in two rows, cast when it was cast.\nv25 It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hindquarters were inward.\nv26 It was a hand width thick. Its brim was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held two thousand baths.\nv27 He made the ten bases of bronze. The length of one base was four cubits, four cubits its width, and three cubits its height.\nv28 The work of the bases was like this: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges;\nv29 and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.\nv30 Every base had four bronze wheels, and axles of bronze; and the four feet of it had supports. The supports were cast beneath the basin, with wreaths at the side of each.\nv31 Its mouth within the capital and above was a cubit. Its mouth was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on its mouth were engravings, and their panels were square, not round.\nv32 The four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axles of the wheels were in the base. The height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.\nv33 The work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel. Their axles, and their rims, and their spokes, and their naves, were all of cast metal.\nv34 There were four supports at the four corners of each base. Its supports were of the base itself.\nv35 In the top of the base there was a round band half a cubit high; and on the top of the base its supports and its panels were the same.\nv36 On the plates of its supports, and on its panels, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, each in its space, with wreaths all around.\nv37 He made the ten bases in this way: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.\nv38 He made ten basins of bronze. One basin contained forty baths; and every basin was four cubits; and on every one of the ten bases one basin.\nv39 He set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house. He set the sea on the right side of the house eastward and toward the south.\nv40 Hiram made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s house:\nv41 the two pillars; the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;\nv42 the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;\nv43 the ten bases; the ten basins on the bases;\nv44 the one sea; the twelve oxen under the sea;\nv45 the pots; the shovels; and the basins: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s house, were of burnished bronze.\nv46 The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.\nv47 Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because there were so many of them. The weight of the bronze could not be determined.\nv48 Solomon made all the vessels that were in Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s house: the golden altar and the table that the show bread was on, of gold;\nv49 and the lamp stands, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the inner sanctuary, of pure gold; and the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;\nv50 the cups, the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, of the temple, of gold.\nv51 Thus all the work that king Solomon did in Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s house was finished. Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, the silver, the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s house.\n","permalink":"https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/1-kings/1-kings-07/","title":"1 Kings 7"},{"content":"v1 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, with all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers\u0026rsquo; households of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s covenant out of David\u0026rsquo;s city, which is Zion.\nv2 All the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.\nv3 All the elders of Israel came, and the priests picked up the ark.\nv4 They brought up Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s ark, the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent.

It is not a new moon or a Sabbath.\u0026rdquo; She said, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s all right.\u0026rdquo;\nv24 Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, \u0026ldquo;Drive, and go forward! Don\u0026rsquo;t slow down for me, unless I ask you to.\u0026rdquo;\nv25 So she went, and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her afar off, he said to Gehazi his servant, \u0026ldquo;Behold, there is the Shunammite.\nv26 Please run now to meet her, and ask her, \u0026lsquo;Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with your child?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; She answered, \u0026ldquo;It is well.\u0026rdquo;\nv27 When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, \u0026ldquo;Leave her alone; for her soul is troubled within her; and Yahweh has hidden it from me, and has not told me.\u0026rdquo;\nv28 Then she said, \u0026ldquo;Did I ask you for a son, my lord? Didn\u0026rsquo;t I say, \u0026lsquo;Do not deceive me\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo;\nv29 Then he said to Gehazi, \u0026ldquo;Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand, and go your way. If you meet any man, don\u0026rsquo;t greet him; and if anyone greets you, don\u0026rsquo;t answer him again. Then lay my staff on the child\u0026rsquo;s face.\u0026rdquo;\nv30 The child\u0026rsquo;s mother said, \u0026ldquo;As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.\u0026rdquo; So he arose, and followed her.\nv31 Gehazi went ahead of them, and laid the staff on the child\u0026rsquo;s face; but there was no voice and no hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, \u0026ldquo;The child has not awakened.\u0026rdquo;\nv32 When Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and lying on his bed.\nv33 He went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to Yahweh.\nv34 He went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. He stretched himself on him; and the child\u0026rsquo;s flesh grew warm.\nv35 Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth; and went up, and stretched himself out on him. Then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.\nv36 He called Gehazi, and said, \u0026ldquo;Call this Shunammite!\u0026rdquo; So he called her. When she had come in to him, he said, \u0026ldquo;Take up your son.\u0026rdquo;\nv37 Then she went in, fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; then she picked up her son, and went out.\nv38 Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, \u0026ldquo;Get the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.\u0026rdquo;\nv39 One went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered a lap full of wild gourds from it, and came and cut them up into the pot of stew; for they didn\u0026rsquo;t recognize them.\nv40 So they poured out for the men to eat. As they were eating some of the stew, they cried out, and said, \u0026ldquo;Man of God, there is death in the pot!\u0026rdquo; And they could not eat it.\nv41 But he said, \u0026ldquo;Then bring meal.\u0026rdquo; He threw it into the pot; and he said, \u0026ldquo;Serve it to the people, that they may eat.\u0026rdquo; And there was nothing harmful in the pot.\nv42 A man from Baal Shalishah came, and brought the man of God some bread of the first fruits: twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. He said, \u0026ldquo;Give to the people, that they may eat.\u0026rdquo;\nv43 His servant said, \u0026ldquo;What, should I set this before a hundred men?\u0026rdquo; But he said, \u0026ldquo;Give the people, that they may eat; for Yahweh says, \u0026lsquo;They will eat, and will have some left over.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nv44 So he set it before them, and they ate, and had some left over, according to Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s word.\n","permalink":"https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/2-kings/2-kings-04/","title":"2 Kings 4"},{"content":"v1 Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.\nv2 The Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman\u0026rsquo;s wife.\nv3 She said to her mistress, \u0026ldquo;I wish that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria!

Now it was so, that when I saw, I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam. I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.\nv3 Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns. The two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.\nv4 I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward. No animals could stand before him. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t any who could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.\nv5 As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth, and didn\u0026rsquo;t touch the ground. The goat had a notable horn between his eyes.\nv6 He came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran on him in the fury of his power.\nv7 I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns. There was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled on him. There was no one who could deliver the ram out of his hand.\nv8 The male goat magnified himself exceedingly. When he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of the sky.\nv9 Out of one of them came out a little horn, which grew exceedingly great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land.\nv10 It grew great, even to the army of the sky; and it cast down some of the army and of the stars to the ground, and trampled on them.\nv11 Yes, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the army; and it took away from him the continual burnt offering, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.\nv12 The army was given over to it together with the continual burnt offering through disobedience. It cast down truth to the ground, and it did its pleasure and prospered.\nv13 Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to that certain one who spoke, \u0026ldquo;How long will the vision about the continual burnt offering, and the disobedience that makes desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the army to be trodden under foot be?\u0026rdquo;\nv14 He said to me, \u0026ldquo;To two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary will be cleansed.\u0026rdquo;\nv15 When I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it. Then behold, there stood before me something like the appearance of a man.\nv16 I heard a man\u0026rsquo;s voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called, and said, \u0026ldquo;Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.\u0026rdquo;\nv17 So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was frightened, and fell on my face; but he said to me, \u0026ldquo;Understand, son of man; for the vision belongs to the time of the end.\u0026rdquo;\nv18 Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.\nv19 He said, \u0026ldquo;Behold, I will make you know what will be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongs to the appointed time of the end.\nv20 The ram which you saw, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.\nv21 The rough male goat is the king of Greece. The great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.\nv22 As for that which was broken, in the place where four stood up, four kingdoms will stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.\nv23 \u0026ldquo;In the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king of fierce face, and understanding dark sentences, will stand up.\nv24 His power will be mighty, but not by his own power. He will destroy awesomely, and will prosper in what he does. He will destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.\nv25 Through his policy he will cause deceit to prosper in his hand. He will magnify himself in his heart, and he will destroy many in their security. He will also stand up against the prince of princes; but he will be broken without hand.\nv26 \u0026ldquo;The vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true; but seal up the vision, for it belongs to many days to come.\u0026rdquo;\nv27 I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick for some days.

Praise of the Philippians I have greatly rejoiced with you in our Lord Jesus Christ, because you have followed the example of true love [as displayed by God], and have accompanied, as became you, those who were bound in chains, the fitting ornaments of saints, and which are indeed the diadems of the true elect of God and our Lord; and because the strong root of your faith, spoken of in days Philippians 1:5 long gone by, endures even until now, and brings forth fruit to our Lord Jesus Christ, who for our sins suffered even unto death, [but] whom God raised from the dead, having loosed the bands of the grave. In whom, though now you see Him not, you believe, and believing, rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory; 1 Peter 1:8 into which joy many desire to enter, knowing that by grace you are saved, not of works, Ephesians 2:8-9 but by the will of God through Jesus Christ.\n2. An exhortation to virtue Wherefore, girding up your loins, 1 Peter 1:13; Ephesians 6:14 serve the Lord in fear and truth, as those who have forsaken the vain, empty talk and error of the multitude, and believed in Him who raised up our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead, and gave Him glory, 1 Peter 1:21 and a throne at His right hand. To Him all things 1 Peter 3:22; Philippians 2:10 in heaven and on earth are subject. Him every spirit serves. He comes as the Judge of the living and the dead. Acts 17:31 His blood will God require of those who do not believe in Him. But He who raised Him up from the dead will raise us up also, if we do His will, and walk in His commandments, and love what He loved, keeping ourselves from all unrighteousness, covetousness, love of money, evil speaking, false witness; not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing, 1 Peter 3:9 or blow for blow, or cursing for cursing, but being mindful of what the Lord said in His teaching: Judge not, that you be not judged; Matthew 7:1 forgive, and it shall be forgiven unto you; be merciful, that you may obtain mercy; Luke 6:36 with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you again; Matthew 7:2; Luke 6:38 and once more, Blessed are the poor, and those that are persecuted for righteousness\u0026rsquo; sake, for theirs is the kingdom of God.\n3. Expressions of personal unworthiness These things, brethren, I write to you concerning righteousness, not because I take anything upon myself, but because you have invited me to do so. For neither I, nor any other such one, can come up to the wisdom 2 Peter 3:15 of the blessed and glorified Paul. He, when among you, accurately and steadfastly taught the word of truth in the presence of those who were then alive. And when absent from you, he wrote you a letter, which, if you carefully study, you will find to be the means of building you up in that faith which has been given you, and which, being followed by hope, and preceded by love towards God, and Christ, and our neighbour, is the mother of us all. Galatians 4:26 For if any one be inwardly possessed of these graces, he has fulfilled the command of righteousness, since he that has love is far from all sin.\n4. Various exhortations But the love of money is the root of all evils. 1 Timothy 6:10 Knowing, therefore, that as we brought nothing into the world, so we can carry nothing out, 1 Timothy 6:7 let us arm ourselves with the armour of righteousness; Ephesians 6:11 and let us teach, first of all, ourselves to walk in the commandments of the Lord. Next, [teach] your wives [to walk] in the faith given to them, and in love and purity tenderly loving their own husbands in all truth, and loving all [others] equally in all chastity; and to train up their children in the knowledge and fear of God. Teach the widows to be discreet as respects the faith of the Lord, praying continually 1 Thessalonians 5:17 for all, being far from all slandering, evil-speaking, false-witnessing, love of money, and every kind of evil; knowing that they are the altar of God, that He clearly perceives all things, and that nothing is hid from Him, neither reasonings, nor reflections, nor any one of the secret things of the heart.\n5. The duties of deacons, youths, and virgins Knowing, then, that God is not mocked, Galatians 6:7 we ought to walk worthy of His commandment and glory. In like manner should the deacons be blameless before the face of His righteousness, as being the servants of God and Christ, and not of men. They must not be slanderers, double-tongued, 1 Timothy 3:8 or lovers of money, but temperate in all things, compassionate, industrious, walking according to the truth of the Lord, who was the servant Matthew 20:28 of all. If we please Him in this present world, we shall receive also the future world, according as He has promised to us that He will raise us again from the dead, and that if we live worthily of Him, we shall also reign together with Him, 2 Timothy 2:12 provided only we believe. In like manner, let the young men also be blameless in all things, being especially careful to preserve purity, and keeping themselves in, as with a bridle, from every kind of evil. For it is well that they should be cut off from the lusts that are in the world, since every lust wars against the spirit; 1 Peter 2:11 and neither fornicators, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, shall inherit the kingdom of God, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 nor those who do things inconsistent and unbecoming. Wherefore, it is needful to abstain from all these things, being subject to the presbyters and deacons, as unto God and Christ. The virgins also must walk in a blameless and pure conscience.\n6. The duties of presbyters and others And let the presbyters be compassionate and merciful to all, bringing back those that wander, visiting all the sick, and not neglecting the widow, the orphan, or the poor, but always providing for that which is becoming in the sight of God and man; Romans 12:17; 2 Corinthians 8:31 abstaining from all wrath, respect of persons, and unjust judgment; keeping far off from all covetousness, not quickly crediting [an evil report] against any one, not severe in judgment, as knowing that we are all under a debt of sin. If then we entreat the Lord to forgive us, we ought also ourselves to forgive; Matthew 6:12-14 for we are before the eyes of our Lord and God, and we must all appear at the judgment-seat of Christ, and must every one give an account of himself. Romans 14:10-12; 2 Corinthians 5:10 Let us then serve Him in fear, and with all reverence, even as He Himself has commanded us, and as the apostles who preached the Gospel unto us, and the prophets who proclaimed beforehand the coming of the Lord [have alike taught us]. Let us be zealous in the pursuit of that which is good, keeping ourselves from causes of offense, from false brethren, and from those who in hypocrisy bear the name of the Lord, and draw away vain men into error.\n7. Avoid the Docetæ, and persevere in fasting and prayer For whosoever does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, is antichrist; 1 John 4:3 and whosoever does not confess the testimony of the cross, is of the devil; and whosoever perverts the oracles of the Lord to his own lusts, and says that there is neither a resurrection nor a judgment, he is the first-born of Satan. Wherefore, forsaking the vanity of many, and their false doctrines, let us return to the word which has been handed down to us from Jude 3 the beginning; watching unto prayer, 1 Peter 4:7 and persevering in fasting; beseeching in our supplications the all-seeing God not to lead us into temptation, Matthew 6:13; Matthew 26:41 as the Lord has said: The spirit truly is willing, but the flesh is weak. Matthew 26:41; Mark 14:38\n8. Persevere in hope and patience Let us then continually persevere in our hope, and the earnest of our righteousness, which is Jesus Christ, who bore our sins in His own body on the tree, 1 Peter 2:24 who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth, 1 Peter 2:22 but endured all things for us, that we might live in Him. 1 John 4:9 Let us then be imitators of His patience; and if we suffer Acts 5:41; 1 Peter 4:16 for His name\u0026rsquo;s sake, let us glorify Him. For He has set us this example 1 Peter 2:21 in Himself, and we have believed that such is the case.\n9. Patience inculcated I exhort you all, therefore, to yield obedience to the word of righteousness, and to exercise all patience, such as you have seen [set] before your eyes, not only in the case of the blessed Ignatius, and Zosimus, and Rufus, but also in others among yourselves, and in Paul himself, and the rest of the apostles. [This do] in the assurance that all these have not run Philippians 2:16; Galatians 2:2 in vain, but in faith and righteousness, and that they are [now] in their due place in the presence of the Lord, with whom also they suffered. For they loved not this present world, but Him who died for us, and for our sakes was raised again by God from the dead.\n10. Exhortation to the practice of virtue Stand fast, therefore, in these things, and follow the example of the Lord, being firm and unchangeable in the faith, loving the brotherhood, 1 Peter 2:17 and being attached to one another, joined together in the truth, exhibiting the meekness of the Lord in your intercourse with one another, and despising no one. When you can do good, defer it not, because alms delivers from death. Tobit 4:10, Tobit 12:9 Be all of you subject one to another 1 Peter 5:5 having your conduct blameless among the Gentiles, 1 Peter 2:12 that you may both receive praise for your good works, and the Lord may not be blasphemed through you. But woe to him by whom the name of the Lord is blasphemed! Isaiah 52:5 Teach, therefore, sobriety to all, and manifest it also in your own conduct.\n11. Expression of grief on account of Valens I am greatly grieved for Valens, who was once a presbyter among you, because he so little understands the place that was given him [in the Church]. I exhort you, therefore, that you abstain from covetousness, and that you be chaste and truthful. Abstain from every form of evil. 1 Thessalonians 5:22 For if a man cannot govern himself in such matters, how shall he enjoin them on others? If a man does not keep himself from covetousness, he shall be defiled by idolatry, and shall be judged as one of the heathen. But who of us are ignorant of the judgment of the Lord? Do we not know that the saints shall judge the world? 1 Corinthians 6:2 as Paul teaches. But I have neither seen nor heard of any such thing among you, in the midst of whom the blessed Paul laboured, and who are commended in the beginning of his Epistle. For he boasts of you in all those Churches which alone then knew the Lord; but we [of Smyrna] had not yet known Him. I am deeply grieved, therefore, brethren, for him (Valens) and his wife; to whom may the Lord grant true repentance! And be then moderate in regard to this matter, and do not count such as enemies, 2 Thessalonians 3:15 but call them back as suffering and straying members, that you may save your whole body. For by so acting you shall edify yourselves. 1 Corinthians 12:26\n12. Exhortation to various graces For I trust that you are well versed in the Sacred Scriptures, and that nothing is hid from you; but to me this privilege is not yet granted. It is declared then in these Scriptures, Be angry, and sin not, and, Let not the sun go down upon your wrath. Ephesians 4:26 Happy is he who remembers this, which I believe to be the case with you. But may the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ Himself, who is the Son of God, and our everlasting High Priest, build you up in faith and truth, and in all meekness, gentleness, patience, long-suffering, forbearance, and purity; and may He bestow on you a lot and portion among His saints, and on us with you, and on all that are under heaven, who shall believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, and in His Father, who raised Him from the dead. Galatians 1:1 Pray for all the saints. Pray also for kings, 1 Timothy 2:2 and potentates, and princes, and for those that persecute and hate you, Matthew 5:44 and for the enemies of the cross, that your fruit may be manifest to all, and that you may be perfect in Him.\n13. Concerning the transmission of epistles Both you and Ignatius wrote to me, that if any one went [from this] into Syria, he should carry your letter with him; which request I will attend to if I find a fitting opportunity, either personally, or through some other acting for me, that your desire may be fulfilled. The Epistles of Ignatius written by him to us, and all the rest [of his Epistles] which we have by us, we have sent to you, as you requested. They are subjoined to this Epistle, and by them you may be greatly profited; for they treat of faith and patience, and all things that tend to edification in our Lord. Any more certain information you may have obtained respecting both Ignatius himself, and those that were with him, have the goodness to make known to us.\n14. Conclusion These things I have written to you by Crescens, whom up to the present time I have recommended unto you, and do now recommend. For he has acted blamelessly among us, and I believe also among you. Moreover, you will hold his sister in esteem when she comes to you. Be safe in the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be with you all. Amen.\nSources  Translated by Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson. From Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. 1. Edited by Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson, and A. Cleveland Coxe.

The couches were of gold and silver, on a pavement of red, white, yellow, and black marble.\nv7 They gave them drinks in golden vessels of various kinds, including royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.\nv8 In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house, that they should do according to every man\u0026rsquo;s pleasure.\nv9 Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus.\nv10 On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcass, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,\nv11 to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown, to show the people and the princes her beauty; for she was beautiful.\nv12 But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king\u0026rsquo;s commandment by the eunuchs. Therefore the king was very angry, and his anger burned in him.\nv13 Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times (for it was the king\u0026rsquo;s custom to consult those who knew law and judgment;\nv14 and next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king\u0026rsquo;s face, and sat first in the kingdom),\nv15 \u0026ldquo;What shall we do to Queen Vashti according to law, because she has not done the bidding of the King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs?\u0026rdquo;\nv16 Memucan answered before the king and the princes, \u0026ldquo;Vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king, but also to all the princes, and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus.\nv17 For this deed of the queen will become known to all women, causing them to show contempt for their husbands, when it is reported, \u0026lsquo;King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t come.\u0026rsquo;\nv18 Today, the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen\u0026rsquo;s deed will tell all the king\u0026rsquo;s princes. This will cause much contempt and wrath.\nv19 \u0026ldquo;If it pleases the king, let a royal commandment go from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it cannot be altered, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another who is better than she.\nv20 When the king\u0026rsquo;s decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give their husbands honor, both great and small.\u0026rdquo;\nv21 This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan:\nv22 for he sent letters into all the king\u0026rsquo;s provinces, into every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, that every man should rule his own house, speaking in the language of his own people.\n","permalink":"https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/esther/esth-01/","title":"Esther 1"},{"content":"v1 After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.\nv2 Then the king\u0026rsquo;s servants who served him said, \u0026ldquo;Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king.\nv3 Let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the beautiful young virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the women\u0026rsquo;s house, to the custody of Hegai the king\u0026rsquo;s eunuch, keeper of the women. Let cosmetics be given them;\nv4 and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.\u0026rdquo; The thing pleased the king, and he did so.\nv5 There was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,\nv6 who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.\nv7 He brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle\u0026rsquo;s daughter; for she had neither father nor mother. The maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.\nv8 So, when the king\u0026rsquo;s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to the citadel of Susa, to the custody of Hegai, Esther was taken into the king\u0026rsquo;s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.\nv9 The maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him. He quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of food, and the seven choice maidens who were to be given her out of the king\u0026rsquo;s house. He moved her and her maidens to the best place in the women\u0026rsquo;s house.\nv10 Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives, because Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make it known.\nv11 Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women\u0026rsquo;s house, to find out how Esther was doing, and what would become of her.\nv12 Each young woman\u0026rsquo;s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after her purification for twelve months (for so were the days of their purification accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet fragrances and with preparations for beautifying women).\nv13 The young woman then came to the king like this: whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women\u0026rsquo;s house to the king\u0026rsquo;s house.\nv14 In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second women\u0026rsquo;s house, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king\u0026rsquo;s eunuch, who kept the concubines. She came in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.\nv15 Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king\u0026rsquo;s eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised. Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked at her.\nv16 So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.\nv17 The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.\nv18 Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants, even Esther\u0026rsquo;s feast; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces, and gave gifts according to the king\u0026rsquo;s bounty.\nv19 When the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king\u0026rsquo;s gate.\nv20 Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people, as Mordecai had commanded her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai, like she did when she was brought up by him.\nv21 In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king\u0026rsquo;s gate, two of the king\u0026rsquo;s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who were doorkeepers, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.\nv22 This thing became known to Mordecai, who informed Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai\u0026rsquo;s name.\nv23 When this matter was investigated, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a gallows; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king\u0026rsquo;s presence.\n","permalink":"https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/esther/esth-02/","title":"Esther 2"},{"content":"v1 After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.\nv2 All the king\u0026rsquo;s servants who were in the king\u0026rsquo;s gate bowed down, and paid homage to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai didn\u0026rsquo;t bow down or pay him homage.\nv3 Then the king\u0026rsquo;s servants, who were in the king\u0026rsquo;s gate, said to Mordecai, \u0026ldquo;Why do you disobey the king\u0026rsquo;s commandment?\u0026rdquo;\nv4 Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he didn\u0026rsquo;t listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai\u0026rsquo;s reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.\nv5 When Haman saw that Mordecai didn\u0026rsquo;t bow down, nor pay him homage, Haman was full of wrath.\nv6 But he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him Mordecai\u0026rsquo;s people. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even Mordecai\u0026rsquo;s people.\nv7 In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, and chose the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.\nv8 Haman said to King Ahasuerus, \u0026ldquo;There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different from other people\u0026rsquo;s. They don\u0026rsquo;t keep the king\u0026rsquo;s laws. Therefore it is not for the king\u0026rsquo;s profit to allow them to remain.\nv9 If it pleases the king, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king\u0026rsquo;s business, to bring it into the king\u0026rsquo;s treasuries.\u0026rdquo;\nv10 The king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews\u0026rsquo; enemy.\nv11 The king said to Haman, \u0026ldquo;The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.\u0026rdquo;\nv12 Then the king\u0026rsquo;s scribes were called in on the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month; and all that Haman commanded was written to the king\u0026rsquo;s local governors, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus, and it was sealed with the king\u0026rsquo;s ring.\nv13 Letters were sent by couriers into all the king\u0026rsquo;s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder their possessions.\nv14 A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.\nv15 The couriers went out in haste by the king\u0026rsquo;s commandment, and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa.

She sent clothing to Mordecai, to replace his sackcloth; but he didn\u0026rsquo;t receive it.\nv5 Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king\u0026rsquo;s eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend her, and commanded him to go to Mordecai, to find out what this was, and why it was.\nv6 So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to city square which was before the king\u0026rsquo;s gate.\nv7 Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king\u0026rsquo;s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.\nv8 He also gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Susa to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to urge her to go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him, for her people.\nv9 Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.\nv10 Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai:\nv11 \u0026ldquo;All the king\u0026rsquo;s servants and the people of the king\u0026rsquo;s provinces know that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to the king into the inner court without being called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king might hold out the golden scepter, that he may live. I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.\u0026rdquo;\nv12 They told Esther\u0026rsquo;s words to Mordecai.\nv13 Then Mordecai asked them to return this answer to Esther: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t think to yourself that you will escape in the king\u0026rsquo;s house any more than all the Jews.\nv14 For if you remain silent now, then relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another place, but you and your father\u0026rsquo;s house will perish.

I and my maidens will also fast the same way. Then I will go in to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.\u0026rdquo;\nv17 So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.\n","permalink":"https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/esther/esth-04/","title":"Esther 4"},{"content":"v1 Now on the third day, Esther put on her royal clothing, and stood in the inner court of the king\u0026rsquo;s house, next to the king\u0026rsquo;s house.

All this was a burnt offering to Yahweh.\nv36 They delivered the king\u0026rsquo;s commissions to the king\u0026rsquo;s local governors, and to the governors beyond the River.

He has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah. He has brought them down to the ground. He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.\nv3 He has cut off all the horn of Israel in fierce anger. He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy.

He has killed all that were pleasant to the eye. In the tent of the daughter of Zion, he has poured out his wrath like fire.\nv5 The Lord has become as an enemy. He has swallowed up Israel. He has swallowed up all her palaces. He has destroyed his strongholds. He has multiplied mourning and lamentation in the daughter of Judah.\nv6 He has violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were a garden. He has destroyed his place of assembly. Yahweh has caused solemn assembly and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion. In the indignation of his anger, he has despised the king and the priest.\nv7 The Lord has cast off his altar. He has abhorred his sanctuary. He has given the walls of her palaces into the hand of the enemy. They have made a noise in Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s house, as in the day of a solemn assembly.\nv8 Yahweh has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion. He has stretched out the line. He has not withdrawn his hand from destroying; He has made the rampart and wall lament. They languish together.\nv9 Her gates have sunk into the ground. He has destroyed and broken her bars. Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not. Yes, her prophets find no vision from Yahweh.\nv10 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground. They keep silence. They have cast up dust on their heads. They have clothed themselves with sackcloth. The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.\nv11 My eyes fail with tears. My heart is troubled. My liver is poured on the earth, because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, because the young children and the infants swoon in the streets of the city.\nv12 They ask their mothers, \u0026ldquo;Where is grain and wine?\u0026rdquo; when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul is poured out into their mothers\u0026rsquo; bosom.\nv13 What shall I testify to you? What shall I liken to you, daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I compare to you, that I may comfort you, virgin daughter of Zion? For your breach is as big as the sea. Who can heal you?\nv14 Your prophets have seen false and foolish visions for you. They have not uncovered your iniquity, to reverse your captivity, but have seen for you false revelations and causes of banishment.\nv15 All that pass by clap their hands at you.

Don\u0026rsquo;t let your eyes rest.\nv19 Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches! Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord. Lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children, who faint for hunger at the head of every street.\nv20 \u0026ldquo;Look, Yahweh, and see to whom you have done thus!

When will you arise out of your sleep?\nv10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:\nv11 so your poverty will come as a robber, and your scarcity as an armed man.\nv12 A worthless person, a man of iniquity, is he who walks with a perverse mouth,\nv13 who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, who motions with his fingers,\nv14 in whose heart is perverseness, who devises evil continually, who always sows discord.\nv15 Therefore his calamity will come suddenly. He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.\nv16 There are six things which Yahweh hates; yes, seven which are an abomination to him:\nv17 arrogant eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,\nv18 a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are swift in running to mischief,\nv19 a false witness who utters lies, and he who sows discord among brothers.\nv20 My son, keep your father\u0026rsquo;s commandment, and don\u0026rsquo;t forsake your mother\u0026rsquo;s teaching.\nv21 Bind them continually on your heart. Tie them around your neck.\nv22 When you walk, it will lead you. When you sleep, it will watch over you. When you awake, it will talk with you.\nv23 For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light. Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,\nv24 to keep you from the immoral woman, from the flattery of the wayward wife\u0026rsquo;s tongue.\nv25 Don\u0026rsquo;t lust after her beauty in your heart, neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.\nv26 For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread. The adulteress hunts for your precious life.\nv27 Can a man scoop fire into his lap, and his clothes not be burned?\nv28 Or can one walk on hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?\nv29 So is he who goes in to his neighbor\u0026rsquo;s wife. Whoever touches her will not be unpunished.\nv30 Men don\u0026rsquo;t despise a thief if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry;\nv31 but if he is found, he shall restore seven times. He shall give all the wealth of his house.\nv32 He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding. He who does it destroys his own soul.\nv33 He will get wounds and dishonor. His reproach will not be wiped away.\nv34 For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband. He won\u0026rsquo;t spare in the day of vengeance.\nv35 He won\u0026rsquo;t regard any ransom, neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.\n","permalink":"https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/proverbs/prov-06/","title":"Proverbs 6"},{"content":"v1 My son, keep my words.

Greeting Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church which is at Ephesus, in Asia, deservedly most happy, being blessed in the greatness and fullness of God the Father, and predestinated before the ages of time, that it should be always for an enduring and unchangeable glory, being united and elected through the true passion by the will of the Father, and Jesus Christ, our God: Abundant happiness through Jesus Christ, and His undefiled grace.\n2. Praise of the Ephesians I have become acquainted with your name, much-beloved in God, which you have acquired by the habit of righteousness, according to the faith and love in Jesus Christ our Saviour. Being the followers of God, and stirring up yourselves by the blood of God, you have perfectly accomplished the work which was beseeming to you. For, on hearing that I came bound from Syria for the common name and hope, trusting through your prayers to be permitted to fight with beasts at Rome, that so by martyrdom I may indeed become the disciple of Him who gave Himself for us, an offering and sacrifice to God\ryou hastened to see me. I received, therefore, your whole multitude in the name of God, through Onesimus, a man of inexpressible love, and your bishop in the flesh, whom I pray you by Jesus Christ to love, and that you would all seek to be like him. And blessed be He who has granted unto you, being worthy, to obtain such an excellent bishop.\n3. Congratulations and entreaties As to my fellow-servant Burrhus, your deacon in regard to God and blessed in all things, I beg that he may continue longer, both for your honour and that of your bishop. And Crocus also, worthy both of God and you, whom I have received as the manifestation of your love, has in all things refreshed me, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ shall also refresh him\r; together with Onesimus, and Burrhus, and Euplus, and Fronto, by means of whom, I have, as to love, beheld all of you. May I always have joy of you, if indeed I be worthy of it. It is therefore befitting that you should in every way glorify Jesus Christ, who has glorified you, that by a unanimous obedience you may be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment, and may all speak the same thing concerning the same thing\r, and that, being subject to the bishop and the presbytery, you may in all respects be sanctified.\n4. Exhortations to unity I do not issue orders to you, as if I were some great person. For though I am bound for the name of Christ, I am not yet perfect in Jesus Christ. For now I begin to be a disciple, and I speak to you as fellow-disciples with me. For it was needful for me to have been stirred up by you in faith, exhortation, patience, and long-suffering. But inasmuch as love suffers me not to be silent in regard to you, I have therefore taken upon me first to exhort you that you would all run together in accordance with the will of God. For even Jesus Christ, our inseparable life, is the manifested will of the Father; as also bishops, settled everywhere to the utmost bounds of the earth, are so by the will of Jesus Christ.\n5. The same continued Wherefore it is fitting that you should run together in accordance with the will of your bishop, which thing also you do. For your justly renowned presbytery, worthy of God, is fitted as exactly to the bishop as the strings are to the harp. Therefore in your concord and harmonious love, Jesus Christ is sung. And man by man, become a choir, that being harmonious in love, and taking up the song of God in unison, you may with one voice sing to the Father through Jesus Christ, so that He may both hear you, and perceive by your works that you are indeed the members of His Son. It is profitable, therefore, that you should live in an unblameable unity, that thus you may always enjoy communion with God.\n6. The praise of unity For if I in this brief space of time, have enjoyed such fellowship with your bishop — I mean not of a mere human, but of a spiritual nature — how much more do I reckon you happy who are so joined to him as the Church is to Jesus Christ, and as Jesus Christ is to the Father, that so all things may agree in unity! Let no man deceive himself: if any one be not within the altar, he is deprived of the bread of God. For if the prayer of one or two possesses\rsuch power, how much more that of the bishop and the whole Church! He, therefore, that does not assemble with the Church, has even by this manifested his pride, and condemned himself. For it is written, God resists the proud. Let us be careful, then, not to set ourselves in opposition to the bishop, in order that we may be subject to God.\n7. Have respect to the bishop as to Christ Himself Now the more any one sees the bishop keeping silence, the more ought he to revere him. For we ought to receive every one whom the Master of the house sends to be over His household\r, as we would do Him that sent him. It is manifest, therefore, that we should look upon the bishop even as we would upon the Lord Himself. And indeed Onesimus himself greatly commends your good order in God, that you all live according to the truth, and that no sect has any dwelling-place among you. Nor, indeed, do you hearken to any one rather than to Jesus Christ speaking in truth.\n8. Beware of false teachers For some are in the habit of carrying about the name of Jesus Christ in wicked guile, while yet they practise things unworthy of God, whom you must flee as you would wild beasts. For they are ravening dogs, who bite secretly, against whom you must be on your guard, inasmuch as they are men who can scarcely be cured. There is one Physician who is possessed both of flesh and spirit; both made and not made; God existing in flesh; true life in death; both of Mary and of God; first passible and then impassible — even Jesus Christ our Lord.\n9.Renewed praise of the Ephesians Let not then any one deceive you, as indeed you are not deceived, inasmuch as you are wholly devoted to God. For since there is no strife raging among you which might distress you, you are certainly living in accordance with God\u0026rsquo;s will. I am far inferior to you, and require to be sanctified by your Church of Ephesus, so renowned throughout the world. They that are carnal cannot do those things which are spiritual, nor they that are spiritual the things which are carnal; even as faith cannot do the works of unbelief, nor unbelief the works of faith. But even those things which you do according to the flesh are spiritual; for you do all things in Jesus Christ.\n10. You have given no heed to false teachers Nevertheless, I have heard of some who have passed on from this to you, having false doctrine, whom you did not allow to sow among you, but stopped your ears, that you might not receive those things which were sown by them, as being stones of the temple of the Father, prepared for the building of God the Father\r, and drawn up on high by the instrument of Jesus Christ, which is the cross, making use of the Holy Spirit as a rope, while your faith was the means by which you ascended, and your love the way which led up to God\r. You, therefore, as well as all your fellow-travellers, are God-bearers, temple-bearers, Christ-bearers, bearers of holiness, adorned in all respects with the commandments of Jesus Christ, in whom also I exult that I have been thought worthy, by means of this Epistle, to converse and rejoice with you, because with respect to your Christian life you love nothing but God only.\n11. Exhortations to prayer, humility, etc And pray without ceasing on behalf of other men. For there is in them hope of repentance that they may attain to God. See, then, that they be instructed by your works, if in no other way. Be meek in response to their wrath, humble in opposition to their boasting: to their blasphemies return your prayers; in contrast to their error, be stedfast in the faith\r; and for their cruelty, manifest your gentleness. While we take care not to imitate their conduct, let us be found their brethren in all true kindness; and let us seek to be followers of the Lord (who ever more unjustly treated, more destitute, more condemned?), that so no plant of the devil may be found in you, but you may remain in all holiness and sobriety in Jesus Christ, both with respect to the flesh and spirit.\n12. An exhortation to fear God The last times have come upon us. Let us therefore be of a reverent spirit, and fear the long-suffering of God, that it tend not to our condemnation. For let us either stand in awe of the wrath to come, or show regard for the grace which is at present displayed — one of two things. Only in one way or another let us be found in Christ Jesus unto the true life. Apart from Him, let nothing attract you, for whom I bear about these bonds, these spiritual jewels, by which may I arise through your prayers, of which I entreat I may always be a partaker, that I may be found in the lot of the Christians of Ephesus, who have always been of the same mind with the apostles through the power of Jesus Christ.\n13. Praise of the Ephesians I know both who I am, and to whom I write. I am a condemned man, you have been the objects of mercy; I am subject to danger, you are established in safety. You are the persons through whom those pass that are cut off for the sake of God. You are initiated into the mysteries of the Gospel with Paul, the holy, the martyred, the deservedly most happy, at whose feet may I be found, when I shall attain to God; who in all his Epistles makes mention of you in Christ Jesus.\n14. Meet together frequently for the worship of God Take heed, then, often to come together to give thanks to God, and show forth His praise. For when you assemble frequently in the same place, the powers of Satan are destroyed, and the destruction at which he aims is prevented by the unity of your faith. Nothing is more precious than peace, by which all war, both in heaven and earth, is brought to an end.\n15. Exhortations to faith and love None of these things is hid from you, if you perfectly possess that faith and love towards Christ Jesus\rwhich are the beginning and the end of life. For the beginning is faith, and the end is love.\rNow these two, being inseparably connected together, are of God, while all other things which are requisite for a holy life follow after them. No man truly making a profession of faith sins; nor does he that possesses love hate any one. The tree is made manifest by its fruit;\rso those that profess themselves to be Christians shall be recognised by their conduct. For there is not now a demand for mere profession, but that a man be found continuing in the power of faith to the end.\n16. Exhortation to confess Christ by silence as well as speech It is better for a man to be silent and be a Christian, than to talk and not to be one. It is good to teach, if he who speaks also acts. There is then one Teacher, who spoke and it was done; while even those things which He did in silence are worthy of the Father. He who possesses the word of Jesus, is truly able to hear even His very silence, that he may be perfect, and may both act as he speaks, and be recognised by his silence. There is nothing which is hid from God, but our very secrets are near to Him. Let us therefore do all things as those who have Him dwelling in us, that we may be His temples\r, and He may be in us as our God, which indeed He is, and will manifest Himself before our faces. Wherefore we justly love Him.\n17. The fate of false teachers Do not err, my brethren.\rThose that corrupt families shall not inherit the kingdom of God. If, then, those who do this as respects the flesh have suffered death,\rhow much more shall this be the case with any one who corrupts by wicked doctrine the faith of God, for which Jesus Christ was crucified! Such an one becoming defiled in this way, shall go away into everlasting fire, and so shall every one that hearkens unto him.\n18. Beware of false doctrines For this end did the Lord allow the ointment to be poured upon His head,\rthat He might breathe immortality into His Church. Be not anointed with the bad odour of the doctrine of the prince of this world; let him not lead you away captive from the life which is set before you. And why are we not all prudent, since we have received the knowledge of God, which is Jesus Christ? Why do we foolishly perish, not recognising the gift which the Lord has of a truth sent to us?\n19. The glory of the cross Let my spirit be counted as nothing for the sake of the cross, which is a stumbling-block to those that do not believe, but to us salvation and life eternal. Where is the wise man? Where the disputer? Where is the boasting of those who are styled prudent?\rFor our God, Jesus Christ, was, according to the appointment of God, conceived in the womb by Mary, of the seed of David, but by the Holy Ghost. He was born and baptized, that by His passion He might purify the water.\n20. hree celebrated mysteries Now the virginity of Mary was hidden from the prince of this world, as was also her offspring, and the death of the Lord; three mysteries of renown, which were wrought in silence by God. How, then, was He manifested to the world? A star shone forth in heaven above all the other stars, the light of which was inexpressible, while its novelty struck men with astonishment. And all the rest of the stars, with the sun and moon, formed a chorus to this star, and its light was exceedingly great above them all. And there was agitation felt as to whence this new spectacle came, so unlike to everything else in the heavens. Hence every kind of magic was destroyed, and every bond of wickedness disappeared; ignorance was removed, and the old kingdom abolished, God Himself being manifested in human form for the renewal of eternal life. And now that took a beginning which had been prepared by God. Henceforth all things were in a state of tumult, because He meditated the abolition of death.\n21. Promise of another letter If Jesus Christ shall graciously permit me through your prayers, and if it be His will, I shall, in a second little work which I will write to you, make further manifest to you the nature of the dispensation of which I have begun to treat, with respect to the new man, Jesus Christ, in His faith and in His love, in His suffering and in His resurrection. Especially will I do this if the Lord make known to me that you come together man by man in common through grace, individually, in one faith, and in Jesus Christ, who was of the seed of David according to the flesh, being both the Son of man and the Son of God, so that you obey the bishop and the presbytery with an undivided mind, breaking one and the same bread, which is the medicine of immortality, and the antidote to prevent us from dying, but which causes that we should live for ever in Jesus Christ.\n22. Conclusion My soul be for yours and theirs whom, for the honour of God, you have sent to Smyrna; whence also I write to you, giving thanks unto the Lord, and loving Polycarp Of Smyrna\reven as I do you. Remember me, as Jesus Christ also remembered you. Pray for the Church which is in Syria, whence I am led bound to Rome, being the last of the faithful who are there, even as I have been thought worthy to be chosen to show forth the honour of God. Farewell in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ, our common hope.\nSources   Translated by Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson. From Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. 1.

They went to Damascus, and lived there, and reigned in Damascus.\nv25 He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, in addition to the mischief of Hadad. He abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.\nv26 Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother\u0026rsquo;s name was Zeruah, a widow, also lifted up his hand against the king.\nv27 This was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of his father David\u0026rsquo;s city.\nv28 The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he put him in charge of all the labor of the house of Joseph.\nv29 At that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the way. Now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and the two of them were alone in the field.\nv30 Ahijah took the new garment that was on him, and tore it in twelve pieces.\nv31 He said to Jeroboam, \u0026ldquo;Take ten pieces; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, \u0026lsquo;Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you\nv32 (but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David\u0026rsquo;s sake and for Jerusalem\u0026rsquo;s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel);\nv33 because they have forsaken me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon. They have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and to keep my statutes and my ordinances, as David his father did.\nv34 \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant\u0026rsquo;s sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;\nv35 but I will take the kingdom out of his son\u0026rsquo;s hand, and will give it to you, even ten tribes.\nv36 I will give one tribe to his son, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for myself to put my name there.\nv37 I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.\nv38 It shall be, if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you.\nv39 I will afflict the offspring of David for this, but not forever.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nv40 Therefore Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.\nv41 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, aren\u0026rsquo;t they written in the book of the acts of Solomon?\nv42 The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.\nv43 Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in his father David\u0026rsquo;s city; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.\n","permalink":"https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/1-kings/1-kings-11/","title":"1 Kings 11"},{"content":"v1 Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.\nv2 When Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was yet in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt,\nv3 and they sent and called him), Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,\nv4 \u0026ldquo;Your father made our yoke difficult. Now therefore make the hard service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.\u0026rdquo;\nv5 He said to them, \u0026ldquo;Depart for three days, then come back to me.\u0026rdquo; So the people departed.\nv6 King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, \u0026ldquo;What counsel do you give me to answer these people?\u0026rdquo;\nv7 They replied, \u0026ldquo;If you will be a servant to this people today, and will serve them, and answer them with good words, then they will be your servants forever.\u0026rdquo;\nv8 But he abandoned the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.\nv9 He said to them, \u0026ldquo;What counsel do you give, that we may answer these people, who have spoken to me, saying, \u0026lsquo;Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nv10 The young men who had grown up with him said to him, \u0026ldquo;Tell these people who spoke to you, saying, \u0026lsquo;Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter to us;\u0026rsquo; tell them, \u0026lsquo;My little finger is thicker than my father\u0026rsquo;s waist.\nv11 Now my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, but I will add to your yoke.

My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.\u0026rdquo;\nv15 So the king didn\u0026rsquo;t listen to the people; for it was a thing brought about from Yahweh, that he might establish his word, which Yahweh spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\nv16 When all Israel saw that the king didn\u0026rsquo;t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, \u0026ldquo;What portion have we in David? We don\u0026rsquo;t have an inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David.\u0026rdquo; So Israel departed to their tents.\nv17 But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.\nv18 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones.

Behold, I conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these?\nv10 Know now that nothing will fall to the earth of Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s word, which Yahweh spoke concerning Ahab\u0026rsquo;s house. For Yahweh has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah.\u0026rdquo;\nv11 So Jehu struck all that remained of Ahab\u0026rsquo;s house in Jezreel, with all his great men, his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him no one remaining.\nv12 He arose and departed, and went to Samaria. As he was at the shearing house of the shepherds on the way,\nv13 Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, \u0026ldquo;Who are you?\u0026rdquo; They answered, \u0026ldquo;We are the brothers of Ahaziah. We are going down to greet the children of the king and the children of the queen.\u0026rdquo;\nv14 He said, \u0026ldquo;Take them alive!\u0026rdquo; They took them alive, and killed them at the pit of the shearing house, even forty-two men. He didn\u0026rsquo;t leave any of them.\nv15 When he had departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him. He greeted him, and said to him, \u0026ldquo;Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?\u0026rdquo; Jehonadab answered, \u0026ldquo;It is.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;If it is, give me your hand.\u0026rdquo; He gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.\nv16 He said, \u0026ldquo;Come with me, and see my zeal for Yahweh.\u0026rdquo; So they made him ride in his chariot.\nv17 When he came to Samaria, he struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according to Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s word, which he spoke to Elijah.\nv18 Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, \u0026ldquo;Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much.\nv19 Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all of his worshipers, and all of his priests. Let no one be absent; for I have a great sacrifice to Baal. Whoever is absent, he shall not live.\u0026rdquo; But Jehu did deceptively, intending to destroy the worshipers of Baal.\nv20 Jehu said, \u0026ldquo;Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal!\u0026rdquo; So they proclaimed it.\nv21 Jehu sent through all Israel; and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that didn\u0026rsquo;t come. They came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another.\nv22 He said to him who kept the wardrobe, \u0026ldquo;Bring out robes for all the worshipers of Baal!\u0026rdquo; So he brought robes out to them.\nv23 Jehu went with Jehonadab the son of Rechab into the house of Baal. Then he said to the worshipers of Baal, \u0026ldquo;Search, and see that none of the servants of Yahweh are here with you, but only the worshipers of Baal.\u0026rdquo;\nv24 So they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed for himself eighty men outside, and said, \u0026ldquo;If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, he who lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him.\u0026rdquo;\nv25 As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, \u0026ldquo;Go in and kill them! Let no one escape.\u0026rdquo; So they struck them with the edge of the sword. The guard and the captains threw the bodies out, and went to the inner shrine of the house of Baal.\nv26 They brought out the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them.\nv27 They broke down the pillar of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a latrine, to this day.\nv28 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.\nv29 However, Jehu didn\u0026rsquo;t depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin, the golden calves that were in Bethel and that were in Dan.\nv30 Yahweh said to Jehu, \u0026ldquo;Because you have done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, and have done to Ahab\u0026rsquo;s house according to all that was in my heart, your descendants shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.\u0026rdquo;\nv31 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Yahweh, the God of Israel, with all his heart.

One said, \u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, Uriah the Hittite\u0026rsquo;s wife?\u0026rdquo;\nv4 David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her house.\nv5 The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, \u0026ldquo;I am with child.\u0026rdquo;\nv6 David sent to Joab, \u0026ldquo;Send me Uriah the Hittite.\u0026rdquo; Joab sent Uriah to David.\nv7 When Uriah had come to him, David asked him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.\nv8 David said to Uriah, \u0026ldquo;Go down to your house and wash your feet.\u0026rdquo; Uriah departed out of the king\u0026rsquo;s house, and a gift from the king was sent after him.\nv9 But Uriah slept at the door of the king\u0026rsquo;s house with all the servants of his lord, and didn\u0026rsquo;t go down to his house.\nv10 When they had told David, saying, \u0026ldquo;Uriah didn\u0026rsquo;t go down to his house,\u0026rdquo; David said to Uriah, \u0026ldquo;Haven\u0026rsquo;t you come from a journey? Why didn\u0026rsquo;t you go down to your house?\u0026rdquo;\nv11 Uriah said to David, \u0026ldquo;The ark, Israel, and Judah, are staying in tents; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go into my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing!\u0026rdquo;\nv12 David said to Uriah, \u0026ldquo;Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.\u0026rdquo; So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.\nv13 When David had called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk. At evening, he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn\u0026rsquo;t go down to his house.\nv14 In the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.\nv15 He wrote in the letter, saying, \u0026ldquo;Send Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck, and die.\u0026rdquo;\nv16 When Joab kept watch on the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.\nv17 The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab. Some of the people fell, even of David\u0026rsquo;s servants; and Uriah the Hittite died also.\nv18 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;\nv19 and he commanded the messenger, saying, \u0026ldquo;When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king,\nv20 it shall be that, if the king\u0026rsquo;s wrath arise, and he asks you, \u0026lsquo;Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Didn\u0026rsquo;t you know that they would shoot from the wall?\nv21 Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn\u0026rsquo;t a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?\u0026rsquo; then you shall say, \u0026lsquo;Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nv22 So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.\nv23 The messenger said to David, \u0026ldquo;The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate.\nv24 The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king\u0026rsquo;s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.\u0026rdquo;\nv25 Then David said to the messenger, \u0026ldquo;Tell Joab, \u0026lsquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it.\u0026rsquo; Encourage him.\u0026rdquo;\nv26 When Uriah\u0026rsquo;s wife heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.\nv27 When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son.

It grew up together with him, and with his children. It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was like a daughter to him.\nv4 A traveler came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to prepare for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but took the poor man\u0026rsquo;s lamb, and prepared it for the man who had come to him.\u0026rdquo;\nv5 David\u0026rsquo;s anger burned hot against the man, and he said to Nathan, \u0026ldquo;As Yahweh lives, the man who has done this deserves to die!\nv6 He must restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity!\u0026rdquo;\nv7 Nathan said to David, \u0026ldquo;You are the man. This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: \u0026lsquo;I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.\nv8 I gave you your master\u0026rsquo;s house, and your master\u0026rsquo;s wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that would have been too little, I would have added to you many more such things.\nv9 Why have you despised Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s word, to do that which is evil in his sight? You have struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.\nv10 Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken Uriah the Hittite\u0026rsquo;s wife to be your wife.\u0026rsquo;\nv11 \u0026ldquo;This is what Yahweh says: \u0026lsquo;Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.\nv12 For you did this secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nv13 David said to Nathan, \u0026ldquo;I have sinned against Yahweh.\u0026rdquo; Nathan said to David, \u0026ldquo;Yahweh also has put away your sin.

Yahweh struck the child that Uriah\u0026rsquo;s wife bore to David, and it was very sick.\nv16 David therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the ground.\nv17 The elders of his house arose beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, and he didn\u0026rsquo;t eat bread with them.\nv18 On the seventh day, the child died. David\u0026rsquo;s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, \u0026ldquo;Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he didn\u0026rsquo;t listen to our voice.

Then he came to his own house; and when he requested, they set bread before him, and he ate.\nv21 Then his servants said to him, \u0026ldquo;What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive, but when the child was dead, you rose up and ate bread.\u0026rdquo;\nv22 He said, \u0026ldquo;While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, \u0026lsquo;Who knows whether Yahweh will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?\u0026rsquo;\nv23 But now he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.\u0026rdquo;\nv24 David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her. She bore a son, and he called his name Solomon.

He brought a great quantity of plunder out of the city.\nv31 He brought out the people who were in it, and put them under saws, under iron picks, under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln; and he did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon.

Won\u0026rsquo;t you tell me?\u0026rdquo; Amnon said to him, \u0026ldquo;I love Tamar, my brother Absalom\u0026rsquo;s sister.\u0026rdquo;\nv5 Jonadab said to him, \u0026ldquo;Lay down on your bed, and pretend to be sick.

When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, \u0026ldquo;Please let my sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.\u0026rdquo;\nv7 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, \u0026ldquo;Go now to your brother Amnon\u0026rsquo;s house, and prepare food for him.\u0026rdquo;\nv8 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon\u0026rsquo;s house; and he was lying down. She took dough, and kneaded it, made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.\nv9 She took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. Amnon said, \u0026ldquo;Have all men leave me.\u0026rdquo; Then every man went out from him.\nv10 Amnon said to Tamar, \u0026ldquo;Bring the food into the room, that I may eat from your hand.\u0026rdquo; Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother.\nv11 When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, \u0026ldquo;Come, lie with me, my sister!\u0026rdquo;\nv12 She answered him, \u0026ldquo;No, my brother, do not force me! For no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Don\u0026rsquo;t you do this folly.\nv13 As for me, where would I carry my shame? And as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.\u0026rdquo;\nv14 However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.\nv15 Then Amnon hated her with exceedingly great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her, \u0026ldquo;Arise, be gone!\u0026rdquo;\nv16 She said to him, \u0026ldquo;Not so, because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me!\u0026rdquo; But he would not listen to her.\nv17 Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, \u0026ldquo;Now put this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.\u0026rdquo;\nv18 She had a garment of various colors on her; for the king\u0026rsquo;s daughters who were virgins dressed in such robes.

The king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.\nv24 Behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down God\u0026rsquo;s ark; and Abiathar went up, until all the people finished passing out of the city.\nv25 The king said to Zadok, \u0026ldquo;Carry God\u0026rsquo;s ark back into the city.

Let him do to me as seems good to him.\u0026rdquo;\nv27 The king said also to Zadok the priest, \u0026ldquo;Aren\u0026rsquo;t you a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.\nv28 Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to inform me.\u0026rdquo;\nv29 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried God\u0026rsquo;s ark to Jerusalem again; and they stayed there.\nv30 David went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot. All the people who were with him each covered his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.\nv31 Someone told David, saying, \u0026ldquo;Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.\u0026rdquo; David said, \u0026ldquo;Yahweh, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.\u0026rdquo;\nv32 When David had come to the top, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his tunic torn, and earth on his head.\nv33 David said to him, \u0026ldquo;If you pass on with me, then you will be a burden to me;\nv34 but if you return to the city, and tell Absalom, \u0026lsquo;I will be your servant, O king. As I have been your father\u0026rsquo;s servant in time past, so I will now be your servant; then will you defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.\u0026rsquo;\nv35 Don\u0026rsquo;t you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you?

He understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.\nv2 In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.\nv3 I ate no pleasant bread. No meat or wine came into my mouth. I didn\u0026rsquo;t anoint myself at all, until three whole weeks were fulfilled.\nv4 In the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel,\nv5 I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold, there was a man clothed in linen, whose thighs were adorned with pure gold of Uphaz.\nv6 His body also was like beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches. His arms and his feet were like burnished bronze. The voice of his words was like the voice of a multitude.\nv7 I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men who were with me didn\u0026rsquo;t see the vision; but a great quaking fell on them, and they fled to hide themselves.\nv8 So I was left alone, and saw this great vision. No strength remained in me; for my face grew deathly pale, and I retained no strength.\nv9 Yet I heard the voice of his words. When I heard the voice of his words, then I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground.\nv10 Behold, a hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands.\nv11 He said to me, \u0026ldquo;Daniel, you greatly beloved man, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright; for I have been sent to you, now.\u0026rdquo; When he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling.\nv12 Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid, Daniel; for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard.

He will refrain some years from the king of the north.\nv9 He will come into the realm of the king of the south, but he will return into his own land.\nv10 His sons will wage war, and will assemble a multitude of great forces, which will come on, and overflow, and pass through.

He will even return, and have regard to those who forsake the holy covenant.\nv31 \u0026ldquo;Forces will stand on his part, and they will profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and will take away the continual burnt offering.

The land of Egypt won\u0026rsquo;t escape.\nv43 But he will have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt. The Libyans and the Ethiopians will be at his steps.\nv44 But news out of the east and out of the north will trouble him; and he will go out with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many.\nv45 He will plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.\n","permalink":"https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/daniel/dan-11/","title":"Daniel 11"},{"content":"v1 \u0026ldquo;At that time Michael will stand up, the great prince who stands for the children of your people; and there will be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time.

Today you shall not find it in the field.\nv26 Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath.

They shall fall under my feet.\nv39 For you have armed me with strength to the battle. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.\nv40 You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me.\nv41 They cried, but there was no one to save; even to Yahweh, but he didn\u0026rsquo;t answer them.\nv42 Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind. I cast them out as the mire of the streets.\nv43 You have delivered me from the strivings of the people. You have made me the head of the nations.

Greeting Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church blessed in the grace of God the Father, in Jesus Christ our Saviour, in whom I salute the Church which is at Magnesia, near the Mæander, and wish it abundance of happiness in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ.\n2. Reason of writing the epistle Having been informed of your godly love, so well-ordered, I rejoiced greatly, and determined to commune with you in the faith of Jesus Christ. For as one who has been thought worthy of the most honourable of all names, in those bonds which I bear about, I commend the Churches, in which I pray for a union both of the flesh and spirit of Jesus Christ, the constant source of our life, and of faith and love, to which nothing is to be preferred, but especially of Jesus and the Father, in whom, if we endure all the assaults of the prince of this world, and escape them, we shall enjoy God.\n3. I rejoice in your messengers Since, then, I have had the privilege of seeing you, through Damas your most worthy bishop, and through your worthy presbyters Bassus and Apollonius, and through my fellow-servant the deacon Sotio, whose friendship may I ever enjoy, inasmuch as he is subject to the bishop as to the grace of God, and to the presbytery as to the law of Jesus Christ, I now write to you.\n4. Honour your youthful bishop Now it becomes you also not to treat your bishop too familiarly on account of his youth, but to yield him all reverence, having respect to the power of God the Father, as I have known even holy presbyters do, not judging rashly, from the manifest youthful appearance of their bishop, but as being themselves prudent in God, submitting to him, or rather not to him, but to the Father of Jesus Christ, the bishop of us all. It is therefore fitting that you should, after no hypocritical fashion, obey your bishop, in honour of Him who has willed us so to do, since he that does not so deceives not by such conduct the bishop that is visible, but seeks to mock Him that is invisible. And all such conduct has reference not to man, but to God, who knows all secrets.\n5. Some wickedly act independently of the bishop It is fitting, then, not only to be called Christians, but to be so in reality: as some indeed give one the title of bishop, but do all things without him. Now such persons seem to me to be not possessed of a good conscience, seeing they are not stedfastly gathered together according to the commandment.\n6. Death is the fate of all such Seeing, then, all things have an end, these two things are simultaneously set before us — death and life; and every one shall go unto his own place. For as there are two kinds of coins, the one of God, the other of the world, and each of these has its special character stamped upon it, so is it also here. The unbelieving are of this world; but the believing have, in love, the character of God the Father by Jesus Christ, by whom, if we are not in readiness to die into His passion, His life is not in us.\n7. Preserve harmony Since therefore I have, in the persons before mentioned, beheld the whole multitude of you in faith and love, I exhort you to study to do all things with a divine harmony, while your bishop presides in the place of God, and your presbyters in the place of the assembly of the apostles, along with your deacons, who are most dear to me, and are entrusted with the ministry of Jesus Christ, who was with the Father before the beginning of time, and in the end was revealed. Do all then, imitating the same divine conduct, pay respect to one another, and let no one look upon his neighbour after the flesh, but continually love each other in Jesus Christ. Let nothing exist among you that may divide you; but be united with your bishop, and those that preside over you, as a type and evidence of your immortality.\n8. Do nothing without the bishop and presbyters As therefore the Lord did nothing without the Father, being united to Him, neither by Himself nor by the apostles, so neither do anything without the bishop and presbyters. Neither endeavour that anything appear reasonable and proper to yourselves apart; but being come together into the same place, let there be one prayer, one supplication, one mind, one hope, in love and in joy undefiled. There is one Jesus Christ, than whom nothing is more excellent. Therefore run together as into one temple of God, as to one altar, as to one Jesus Christ, who came forth from one Father, and is with and has gone to one.\n9. Caution against false doctrines Be not deceived with strange doctrines, nor with old fables, which are unprofitable. For if we still live according to the Jewish law, we acknowledge that we have not received grace. For the divinest prophets lived according to Christ Jesus. On this account also they were persecuted, being inspired by His grace to fully convince the unbelieving that there is one God, who has manifested Himself by Jesus Christ His Son, who is His eternal Word, not proceeding forth from silence, and who in all things pleased Him that sent Him.\n10. Let us live with Christ If, therefore, those who were brought up in the ancient order of things have come to the possession of a new hope, no longer observing the Sabbath, but living in the observance of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Day, on which also our life has sprung up again by Him and by His death — whom some deny, by which mystery we have obtained faith, and therefore endure, that we may be found the disciples of Jesus Christ, our only Master — how shall we be able to live apart from Him, whose disciples the prophets themselves in the Spirit did wait for Him as their Teacher? And therefore He whom they rightly waited for, having come, raised them from the dead\r.\n11. Beware of Judaizing Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His kindness. For were He to reward us according to our works, we should cease to be. Therefore, having become His disciples, let us learn to live according to the principles of Christianity. For whosoever is called by any other name besides this, is not of God. Lay aside, therefore, the evil, the old, the sour leaven, and be changed into the new leaven, which is Jesus Christ. Be salted in Him, lest any one among you should be corrupted, since by your savour you shall be convicted. It is absurd to profess Christ Jesus, and to Judaize. For Christianity did not embrace Judaism, but Judaism Christianity, that so every tongue which believes might be gathered together to God.\n12. I write these things to warn you These things I address to you, my beloved, not that I know any of you to be in such a state; addicted to the error of Judaizing\rbut, as less than any of you, I desire to guard you beforehand, that you fall not upon the hooks of vain doctrine, but that you attain to full assurance in regard to the birth, and passion, and resurrection which took place in the time of the government of Pontius Pilate, being truly and certainly accomplished by Jesus Christ, who is our hope\r, from which may no one of you ever be turned aside.\n13. You are superior to me May I enjoy you in all respects, if indeed I be worthy! For though I am bound, I am not worthy to be compared to any of you that are at liberty. I know that you are not puffed up, for you have Jesus Christ in yourselves. And all the more when I commend you, I know that you cherish modesty of spirit; as it is written, The righteous man is his own accuser\r.\n14. Be established in faith and unity Study, therefore, to be established in the doctrines of the Lord and the apostles, that so all things, whatsoever you do, may prosper both in the flesh and spirit; in faith and love; in the Son, and in the Father, and in the Spirit; in the beginning and in the end; with your most admirable bishop, and the well-compacted spiritual crown of your presbytery, and the deacons who are according to God. Be subject to the bishop, and to one another, as Jesus Christ to the Father, according to the flesh, and the apostles to Christ, and to the Father, and to the Spirit; that so there may be a union both fleshly and spiritual.\n15. Your prayers requested Knowing as I do that you are full of God, I have but briefly exhorted you. Be mindful of me in your prayers, that I may attain to God; and of the Church which is in Syria, whence I am not worthy to derive my name: for I stand in need of your united prayer in God, and your love, that the Church which is in Syria may be deemed worthy of being refreshed by your Church.\n16. Salutations The Ephesians from Smyrna (whence I also write to you), who are here for the glory of God, as you also are, who have in all things refreshed me, salute you, along with Polycarp\r, the bishop of the Smyrnæans. The rest of the Churches, in honour of Jesus Christ, also salute you. Fare well in the harmony of God, you who have obtained the inseparable Spirit, who is Jesus Christ.\nSources   Translated by Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson. From Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. 1.

Some urged me to kill you; but I spared you; and I said, I will not stretch out my hand against my lord; for he is Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s anointed.\nv11 Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and didn\u0026rsquo;t kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, though you hunt for my life to take it.\nv12 May Yahweh judge between me and you, and may Yahweh avenge me of you; but my hand will not be on you.\nv13 As the proverb of the ancients says, \u0026lsquo;Out of the wicked comes wickedness;\u0026rsquo; but my hand will not be on you.\nv14 Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea?\nv15 May Yahweh therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.\u0026rdquo;\nv16 It came to pass, when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, \u0026ldquo;Is that your voice, my son David?\u0026rdquo; Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.\nv17 He said to David, \u0026ldquo;You are more righteous than I; for you have done good to me, whereas I have done evil to you.\nv18 You have declared today how you have dealt well with me, because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand, you didn\u0026rsquo;t kill me.\nv19 For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed? Therefore may Yahweh reward you good for that which you have done to me today.\nv20 Now, behold, I know that you will surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand.\nv21 Swear now therefore to me by Yahweh, that you will not cut off my offspring after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father\u0026rsquo;s house.\u0026rdquo;\nv22 David swore to Saul.

Then David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.\nv2 There was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great. He had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats; and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.\nv3 Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail. This woman was intelligent and had a beautiful face; but the man was surly and evil in his doings. He was of the house of Caleb.\nv4 David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.\nv5 David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, \u0026ldquo;Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name.\nv6 Tell him, \u0026lsquo;Long life to you! Peace be to you! Peace be to your house! Peace be to all that you have!\nv7 Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds have now been with us, and we didn\u0026rsquo;t harm them. Nothing was missing from them all the time they were in Carmel.\nv8 Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes; for we come on a good day. Please give whatever comes to your hand, to your servants, and to your son David.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nv9 When David\u0026rsquo;s young men came, they spoke to Nabal all those words in the name of David, and waited.\nv10 Nabal answered David\u0026rsquo;s servants, and said, \u0026ldquo;Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants who break away from their masters these days.\nv11 Shall I then take my bread, my water, and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who I don\u0026rsquo;t know where they come from?\u0026rdquo;\nv12 So David\u0026rsquo;s young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him all these words.\nv13 David said to his men, \u0026ldquo;Every man put on his sword!\u0026rdquo; Every man put on his sword. David also put on his sword. About four hundred men followed David, and two hundred stayed by the baggage.\nv14 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal\u0026rsquo;s wife, saying, \u0026ldquo;Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master; and he insulted them.\nv15 But the men were very good to us, and we were not harmed, and we didn\u0026rsquo;t miss anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields.\nv16 They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.\nv17 Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house; for he is such a worthless fellow that one can\u0026rsquo;t speak to him.\u0026rdquo;\nv18 Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two containers of wine, five sheep ready dressed, five seahs of parched grain, one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.\nv19 She said to her young men, \u0026ldquo;Go on before me. Behold, I am coming after you.\u0026rdquo; But she didn\u0026rsquo;t tell her husband, Nabal.\nv20 As she rode on her donkey, and came down hidden by the mountain, behold, David and his men came down toward her, and she met them.\nv21 Now David had said, \u0026ldquo;Surely in vain I have kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him. He has returned me evil for good.\nv22 God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall.\u0026rdquo;\nv23 When Abigail saw David, she hurried and got off her donkey, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.\nv24 She fell at his feet, and said, \u0026ldquo;On me, my lord, on me be the blame! Please let your servant speak in your ears. Hear the words of your servant.\nv25 Please don\u0026rsquo;t let my lord pay attention to this worthless fellow, Nabal; for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; but I, your servant, didn\u0026rsquo;t see my lord\u0026rsquo;s young men, whom you sent.\nv26 Now therefore, my lord, as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, since Yahweh has withheld you from blood guiltiness, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now therefore let your enemies, and those who seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.\nv27 Now this present which your servant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord.\nv28 Please forgive the trespass of your servant. For Yahweh will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fights Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s battles. Evil will not be found in you all your days.\nv29 Though men may rise up to pursue you, and to seek your soul, yet the soul of my lord will be bound in the bundle of life with Yahweh your God. He will sling out the souls of your enemies, as from the hollow of a sling.\nv30 It will come to pass, when Yahweh has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you prince over Israel,\nv31 that this shall be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. When Yahweh has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant.\u0026rdquo;\nv32 David said to Abigail, \u0026ldquo;Blessed is Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sent you today to meet me!\nv33 Blessed is your discretion, and blessed are you, who have kept me today from blood guiltiness, and from avenging myself with my own hand.\nv34 For indeed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, who has withheld me from harming you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, surely there wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been left to Nabal by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall.\u0026rdquo;\nv35 So David received from her hand that which she had brought him. Then he said to her, \u0026ldquo;Go up in peace to your house. Behold, I have listened to your voice, and have granted your request.\u0026rdquo;\nv36 Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. Nabal\u0026rsquo;s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk. Therefore she told him nothing until the morning light.\nv37 In the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.\nv38 About ten days later, Yahweh struck Nabal, so that he died.\nv39 When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, \u0026ldquo;Blessed is Yahweh, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil. Yahweh has returned the evildoing of Nabal on his own head.\u0026rdquo; David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to himself as wife.\nv40 When David\u0026rsquo;s servants had come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, \u0026ldquo;David has sent us to you, to take you to him as wife.\u0026rdquo;\nv41 She arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, \u0026ldquo;Behold, your servant is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.\u0026rdquo;\nv42 Abigail hurried, and arose, and rode on a donkey, with five ladies of hers who followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.\nv43 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they both became his wives.\nv44 Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David\u0026rsquo;s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.\n","permalink":"https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/1-samuel/1-sam-25/","title":"1 Samuel 25"},{"content":"v1 The Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, \u0026ldquo;Doesn\u0026rsquo;t David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?\u0026rdquo;\nv2 Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.\nv3 Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way.

Behold, they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz. You will find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.\nv17 You will not need to fight this battle.

As they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, \u0026ldquo;Listen to me, Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in Yahweh your God, so you will be established! Believe his prophets, so you will prosper.\u0026rdquo;\nv21 When he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those who were to sing to Yahweh, and give praise in holy array, as they go out before the army, and say, \u0026ldquo;Give thanks to Yahweh; for his loving kindness endures forever.\u0026rdquo;\nv22 When they began to sing and to praise, Yahweh set ambushers against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were struck.\nv23 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to utterly kill and destroy them. When they had finished the inhabitants of Seir, everyone helped to destroy each other.\nv24 When Judah came to the place overlooking the wilderness, they looked at the multitude; and behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none who escaped.\nv25 When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their plunder, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away. They took plunder for three days, it was so much.\nv26 On the fourth day, they assembled themselves in Beracah Valley, for there they blessed Yahweh. Therefore the name of that place was called \u0026ldquo;Beracah Valley\u0026rdquo; to this day.\nv27 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat in front of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for Yahweh had made them to rejoice over their enemies.\nv28 They came to Jerusalem with stringed instruments, harps, and trumpets to Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s house.\nv29 The fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that Yahweh fought against the enemies of Israel.\nv30 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest all around.\nv31 Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah.

Greeting Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the holy Church which is at Tralles, in Asia, beloved of God, the Father of Jesus Christ, elect, and worthy of God, possessing peace through the flesh, and blood, and passion of Jesus Christ, who is our hope, through our rising again to Him, which also I salute in its fullness, and in the apostolic character, and wish abundance of happiness.\n2. Acknowledgment of their excellence I know that you possess an unblameable and sincere mind in patience, and that not only in present practice, but according to inherent nature, as Polybius your bishop has shown me, who has come to Smyrna by the will of God and Jesus Christ, and so sympathized in the joy which I, who am bound in Christ Jesus, possess, that I beheld your whole multitude in him. Having therefore received through him the testimony of your good-will, according to God, I gloried to find you, as I knew you were, the followers of God.\n3. Be subject to the bishop For, since you are subject to the bishop as to Jesus Christ, you appear to me to live not after the manner of men, but according to Jesus Christ, who died for us, in order, by believing in His death, you may escape from death. It is therefore necessary that, as you indeed do, so without the bishop you should do nothing, but should also be subject to the presbytery, as to the apostle of Jesus Christ, who is our hope, in whom, if we live, we shall at last be found. It is fitting also that the deacons, as being the ministers of the mysteries of Jesus Christ, should in every respect be pleasing to all. For they are not ministers of meat and drink, but servants of the Church of God. They are bound, therefore, to avoid all grounds of accusation against them, as they would do fire.\n4. Honour the deacons In like manner, let all reverence the deacons as an appointment of Jesus Christ, and the bishop as Jesus Christ, who is the Son of the Father, and the presbyters as the sanhedrim of God, and assembly of the apostles. Apart from these, there is no Church. Concerning all this, I am persuaded that you are of the same opinion. For I have received the manifestation of your love, and still have it with me, in your bishop, whose very appearance is highly instructive, and his meekness of itself a power; whom I imagine even the ungodly must reverence, seeing they are also pleased that I do not spare myself. But shall I, when permitted to write on this point, reach such a height of self-esteem, that though being a condemned man, I should issue commands to you as if I were an apostle?\n5. I have need of humility I have great knowledge in God, but I restrain myself, lest, I should perish through boasting. For now it is needful for me to be the more fearful; and not give heed to those that puff me up. For they that speak to me in the way of commendation scourge me. For I do indeed desire to suffer, but I know not if I be worthy to do so. For this longing, though it is not manifest to many, all the more vehemently assails me. I therefore have need of meekness, by which the prince of this world is brought to nought.\n6. I will not teach you profound doctrines Am I not able to write to you of heavenly things? But I fear to do so, lest I should inflict injury on you who are but babes in Christ. Pardon me in this respect, lest, as not being able to receive such doctrines, you should be strangled by them. For even I, though I am bound for Christ, yet am not on that account able to understand heavenly things, and the places of the angels, and their gatherings under their respective princes, things visible and invisible. Without reference to such abstruse subjects, I am still but a learner in other respects; for many things are wanting to us, that we come not short of God.\n7. Abstain from the poison of heretics I therefore, yet not I, but the love of Jesus Christ, entreat you that you use Christian nourishment only, and abstain from herbage of a different kind; I mean heresy. For those that are given to this mix up Jesus Christ with their own poison, speaking things which are unworthy of credit, like those who administer a deadly drug in sweet wine, which he who is ignorant of does greedily take, with a fatal pleasure leading to his own death.\n8. The same continued Be on your guard, therefore, against such persons. And this will be the case with you if you are not puffed up, and continue in intimate union with Jesus Christ our God, and the bishop, and the enactments of the apostles. He that is within the altar is pure, but he that is without is not pure; that is, he who does anything apart from the bishop, and presbytery, and deacons, such a man is not pure in his conscience.\n9. Be on your guard against the snares of the devil Not that I know there is anything of this kind among you; but I put you on your guard, inasmuch as I love you greatly, and foresee the snares of the devil. Wherefore, clothing yourselves with meekness, be renewed in faith, that is the flesh of the Lord, and in love, that is the blood of Jesus Christ. Let no one of you cherish any grudge against his neighbour. Give no occasion to the Gentiles, lest by means of a few foolish men the whole multitude of those that believe in God be evil spoken of. For, Woe to him by whose vanity my name is blasphemed among any.\r10. Reference to the history of Christ Stop your ears, therefore, when any one speaks to you at variance with Jesus Christ, who was descended from David, and was also of Mary; who was truly born, and ate and drank. He was truly persecuted under Pontius Pilate; He was truly crucified, and truly died, in the sight of beings in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth. He was also truly raised from the dead, His Father quickening Him, even as after the same manner His Father will so raise up us who believe in Him by Christ Jesus, apart from whom we do not possess the true life.\n11. The reality of Christ\u0026rsquo;s passion But if, as some that are without God, that is, the unbelieving, say, that He only seemed to suffer (they themselves only seeming to exist), then why am I in bonds? Why do I long to be exposed to the wild beasts? Do I therefore die in vain? Am I not then guilty of falsehood against the cross of the Lord?\n12. Avoid the deadly errors of the Docetæ Flee, therefore, those evil offshoots of Satan, which produce death-bearing fruit, whereof if any one tastes, he instantly dies. For these men are not the planting of the Father. For if they were, they would appear as branches of the cross, and their fruit would be incorruptible. By it He calls you through His passion, as being His members. The head, therefore, cannot be born by itself, without its members; God, who is the Saviour Himself, having promised their union.\n13. Continue in unity and love I salute you from Smyrna, together with the Churches of God which are with me, who have refreshed me in all things, both in the flesh and in the spirit. My bonds, which I carry about with me for the sake of Jesus Christ (praying that I may attain to God), exhort you. Continue in harmony among yourselves, and in prayer with one another; for it becomes every one of you, and especially the presbyters, to refresh the bishop, to the honour of the Father, of Jesus Christ, and of the apostles. I entreat you in love to hear me, that I may not, by having written, be a testimony against you. And also pray for me, who have need of your love, along with the mercy of God, that I may be worthy of the lot for which I am destined, and that I may not be found reprobate.\n14. Conclusion The love of the Smyrnæans and Ephesians salutes you. Remember in your prayers the Church which is in Syria, from which also I am not worthy to receive my appellation, being the last of them. Fare well in Jesus Christ, while you continue subject to the bishop, as to the command of God, and in like manner to the presbytery. And, every man, love one another with an undivided heart. Let my spirit be sanctified by yours, not only now, but also when I shall attain to God. For I am as yet exposed to danger. But the Father is faithful in Jesus Christ to fulfil both mine and your petitions: in whom may you be found unblameable.\nSource  Translated by Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson. From Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. 1. Edited by Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson, and A.

They didn\u0026rsquo;t kill any, but carried them off, and went their way.\nv3 When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, their sons, and their daughters were taken captive.\nv4 Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep.\nv5 David\u0026rsquo;s two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.\nv6 David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the souls of all the people were grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters; but David strengthened himself in Yahweh his God.\nv7 David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, \u0026ldquo;Please bring the ephod here to me.\u0026rdquo; Abiathar brought the ephod to David.\nv8 David inquired of Yahweh, saying, \u0026ldquo;If I pursue after this troop, will I overtake them?\u0026rdquo; He answered him, \u0026ldquo;Pursue; for you will surely overtake them, and will without fail recover all.\u0026rdquo;\nv9 So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.\nv10 But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they couldn\u0026rsquo;t go over the brook Besor.\nv11 They found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink.\nv12 They gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, and drank no water for three days and three nights.\nv13 David asked him, \u0026ldquo;To whom do you belong? Where are you from?\u0026rdquo; He said, \u0026ldquo;I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I got sick.\nv14 We made a raid on the South of the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.\u0026rdquo;\nv15 David said to him, \u0026ldquo;Will you bring me down to this troop?\u0026rdquo; He said, \u0026ldquo;Swear to me by God that you will not kill me and not deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this troop.\u0026rdquo;\nv16 When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread around over all the ground, eating, drinking, and dancing, because of all the great plunder that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.\nv17 David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped from there, except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.\nv18 David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and David rescued his two wives.\nv19 There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither plunder, nor anything that they had taken. David brought them all back.\nv20 David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other livestock, and said, \u0026ldquo;This is David\u0026rsquo;s plunder.\u0026rdquo;\nv21 David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to stay at the brook Besor; and they went out to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him. When David came near to the people, he greeted them.\nv22 Then all the wicked men and worthless fellows, of those who went with David, answered and said, \u0026ldquo;Because they didn\u0026rsquo;t go with us, we will not give them anything of the plunder that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart.\u0026rdquo;\nv23 Then David said, \u0026ldquo;Do not do so, my brothers, with that which Yahweh has given to us, who has preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.\nv24 Who will listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who stays with the baggage. They shall share alike.\u0026rdquo;\nv25 It was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.\nv26 When David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, \u0026ldquo;Behold, a present for you from the plunder of Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s enemies.\u0026rdquo;\nv27 He sent it to those who were in Bethel, to those who were in Ramoth of the South, to those who were in Jattir,\nv28 to those who were in Aroer, to those who were in Siphmoth, to those who were in Eshtemoa,\nv29 to those who were in Racal, to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, to those who were in the cities of the Kenites,\nv30 to those who were in Hormah, to those who were in Borashan, to those who were in Athach,\nv31 to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men used to stay.\n","permalink":"https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/1-samuel/1-sam-30/","title":"1 Samuel 30"},{"content":"v1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa.\nv2 The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.\nv3 The battle went hard against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.\nv4 Then Saul said to his armor bearer, \u0026ldquo;Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me!\u0026rdquo; But his armor bearer would not; for he was terrified.

The priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s house.\nv16 They stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites.\nv17 For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites were in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to Yahweh.\nv18 For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover other than the way it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, \u0026ldquo;May the good Yahweh pardon everyone\nv19 who sets his heart to seek God, Yahweh, the God of his fathers, even if they aren\u0026rsquo;t clean according to the purification of the sanctuary.\u0026rdquo;\nv20 Yahweh listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.\nv21 The children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness.

So they ate throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace offerings, and making confession to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.\nv23 The whole assembly took counsel to keep another seven days, and they kept another seven days with gladness.\nv24 For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.\nv25 All the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly who came out of Israel, and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel, and who lived in Judah, rejoiced.\nv26 So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was nothing like this in Jerusalem.\nv27 Then the Levitical priests arose and blessed the people.

Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.\nv2 Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites after their divisions, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s camp.\nv3 He also appointed the king\u0026rsquo;s portion of his possessions for the burnt offerings, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s law.\nv4 Moreover he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s law.\nv5 As soon as the commandment went out, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first fruits of grain, new wine, oil, honey, and of all the increase of the field; and they brought in the tithe of all things abundantly.\nv6 The children of Israel and Judah, who lived in the cities of Judah, also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to Yahweh their God, and laid them in heaps.\nv7 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.\nv8 When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Yahweh and his people Israel.\nv9 Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites about the heaps.\nv10 Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, \u0026ldquo;Since people began to bring the offerings into Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s house, we have eaten and had enough, and have plenty left over, for Yahweh has blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.\u0026rdquo;\nv11 Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s house, and they prepared them.\nv12 They brought in the offerings, the tithes, and the dedicated things faithfully. Conaniah the Levite was ruler over them, and Shimei his brother was second.\nv13 Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of God\u0026rsquo;s house.\nv14 Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the gatekeeper at the east gate, was over the free will offerings of God, to distribute Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s offerings and the most holy things.\nv15 Under him were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brothers by divisions, to the great as well as to the small;\nv16 in addition to those who were listed by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even everyone who entered into Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s house, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their offices according to their divisions;\nv17 and those who were listed by genealogy of the priests by their fathers\u0026rsquo; houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their divisions;\nv18 and those who were listed by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation; for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness.\nv19 Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the pasture lands of their cities, in every city, there were men who were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all who were listed by genealogy among the Levites.\nv20 Hezekiah did so throughout all Judah; and he did that which was good, right, and faithful before Yahweh his God.\nv21 In every work that he began in the service of God\u0026rsquo;s house, in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.\n","permalink":"https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/2-chronicles/2-chron-31/","title":"2 Chronicles 31"},{"content":"v1 After these things and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and intended to win them for himself.\nv2 When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that he was planning to fight against Jerusalem,\nv3 he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city, and they helped him.\nv4 So, many people gathered together and they stopped all the springs and the brook that flowed through the middle of the land, saying, \u0026ldquo;Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find abundant water?\u0026rdquo;\nv5 He took courage, built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, with the other wall outside, and strengthened Millo in David\u0026rsquo;s city, and made weapons and shields in abundance.\nv6 He set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the wide place at the gate of the city, and spoke encouragingly to them, saying,\nv7 \u0026ldquo;Be strong and courageous.

How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand?\u0026rdquo;\nv16 His servants spoke yet more against Yahweh God, and against his servant Hezekiah.\nv17 He also wrote letters insulting Yahweh, the God of Israel, and speaking against him, saying, \u0026ldquo;As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall the God of Hezekiah not deliver his people out of my hand.\u0026rdquo;\nv18 They called out with a loud voice in the Jews\u0026rsquo; language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.\nv19 They spoke of the God of Jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men\u0026rsquo;s hands.\nv20 Hezekiah the king and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.\nv21 Yahweh sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. When he had come into the house of his god, those who came out of his own body killed him there with the sword.\nv22 Thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.\nv23 Many brought gifts to Yahweh to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from then on.\nv24 In those days Hezekiah was terminally ill, and he prayed to Yahweh; and he spoke to him, and gave him a sign.\nv25 But Hezekiah didn\u0026rsquo;t reciprocate appropriate to the benefit done for him, because his heart was lifted up.

Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.\u0026rdquo;\nv17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels,\nv18 and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan.\nv19 Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep; and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father\u0026rsquo;s.\nv20 Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn\u0026rsquo;t tell him that he was running away.\nv21 So he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.\nv22 Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.\nv23 He took his relatives with him, and pursued him seven days\u0026rsquo; journey. He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.\nv24 God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said to him, \u0026ldquo;Be careful that you don\u0026rsquo;t speak to Jacob either good or bad.\u0026rdquo;\nv25 Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead.\nv26 Laban said to Jacob, \u0026ldquo;What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?\nv27 Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn\u0026rsquo;t tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp;\nv28 and didn\u0026rsquo;t allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly.\nv29 It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, \u0026lsquo;Be careful that you don\u0026rsquo;t speak to Jacob either good or bad.\u0026rsquo;\nv30 Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father\u0026rsquo;s house, but why have you stolen my gods?\u0026rdquo;\nv31 Jacob answered Laban, \u0026ldquo;Because I was afraid, for I said, \u0026lsquo;Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.\u0026rsquo;\nv32 Anyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it.\u0026rdquo; For Jacob didn\u0026rsquo;t know that Rachel had stolen them.\nv33 Laban went into Jacob\u0026rsquo;s tent, into Leah\u0026rsquo;s tent, and into the tent of the two female servants; but he didn\u0026rsquo;t find them. He went out of Leah\u0026rsquo;s tent, and entered into Rachel\u0026rsquo;s tent.\nv34 Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel\u0026rsquo;s saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt around all the tent, but didn\u0026rsquo;t find them.\nv35 She said to her father, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t let my lord be angry that I can\u0026rsquo;t rise up before you; for I\u0026rsquo;m having my period.\u0026rdquo; He searched, but didn\u0026rsquo;t find the teraphim.\nv36 Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, \u0026ldquo;What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?\nv37 Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.\nv38 \u0026ldquo;These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t eaten the rams of your flocks.\nv39 That which was torn of animals, I didn\u0026rsquo;t bring to you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.\nv40 This was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes.\nv41 These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.\nv42 Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.\u0026rdquo;\nv43 Laban answered Jacob, \u0026ldquo;The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine! What can I do today to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?\nv44 Now come, let\u0026rsquo;s make a covenant, you and I. Let it be for a witness between me and you.\u0026rdquo;\nv45 Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.\nv46 Jacob said to his relatives, \u0026ldquo;Gather stones.\u0026rdquo; They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by the heap.\nv47 Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.\nv48 Laban said, \u0026ldquo;This heap is witness between me and you today.\u0026rdquo; Therefore it was named Galeed\nv49 and Mizpah, for he said, \u0026ldquo;Yahweh watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.\nv50 If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives in addition to my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you.\u0026rdquo;\nv51 Laban said to Jacob, \u0026ldquo;See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you.\nv52 May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.\nv53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.\u0026rdquo; Then Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac.\nv54 Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain.\nv55 Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them.

As a prisoner, I hope to see you Through prayer to God I have obtained the privilege of seeing your most worthy faces, and have even been granted more than I requested; for I hope as a prisoner in Christ Jesus to salute you, if indeed it be the will of God that I be thought worthy of attaining unto the end. For the beginning has been well ordered, if I may obtain grace to cling to my lot without hindrance unto the end. For I am afraid of your love, lest it should do me an injury. For it is easy for you to accomplish what you please; but it is difficult for me to attain to God, if you spare me.\n2. Do not save me from martyrdom For it is not my desire to act towards you as a man-pleaser, but as pleasing God, even as also you please Him. For neither shall I ever have such another opportunity of attaining to God; nor will you, if you shall now be silent, ever be entitled to the honour of a better work. For if you are silent concerning me, I shall become God\u0026rsquo;s; but if you show your love to my flesh, I shall again have to run my race. Pray, then, do not seek to confer any greater favour upon me than that I be sacrificed to God while the altar is still prepared; that, being gathered together in love, you may sing praise to the Father, through Christ Jesus, that God has deemed me, the bishop of Syria, worthy to be sent for from the east unto the west. It is good to set from the world unto God, that I may rise again to Him.\n3. Pray rather that I may attain to martyrdom You have never envied any one; you have taught others. Now I desire that those things may be confirmed by your conduct, which in your instructions you enjoin on others. Only request in my behalf both inward and outward strength, that I may not only speak, but truly will; and that I may not merely be called a Christian, but really be found to be one. For if I be truly found a Christian, I may also be called one, and be then deemed faithful, when I shall no longer appear to the world. Nothing visible is eternal. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. For our God, Jesus Christ, now that He is with the Father, is all the more revealed in His glory. Christianity is not a thing of silence only, but also of manifest greatness.\n4. Allow me to fall a prey to the wild beasts I write to the Churches, and impress on them all, that I shall willingly die for God, unless you hinder me. I beseech of you not to show an unseasonable good-will towards me. Allow me to become food for the wild beasts, through whose instrumentality it will be granted me to attain to God. I am the wheat of God, and let me be ground by the teeth of the wild beasts, that I may be found the pure bread of Christ. Rather entice the wild beasts, that they may become my tomb, and may leave nothing of my body; so that when I have fallen asleep in death, I may be no trouble to any one. Then shall I truly be a disciple of Christ, when the world shall not see so much as my body. Entreat Christ for me, that by these instruments I may be found a sacrifice to God. I do not, as Peter and Paul, issue commandments unto you. They were apostles; I am but a condemned man: they were free, while I am, even until now, a servant. But when I suffer, I shall be the freed-man of Jesus, and shall rise again emancipated in Him. And now, being a prisoner, I learn not to desire anything worldly or vain.\n5. I desire for life From Syria even unto Rome I fight with beasts, both by land and sea, both by night and day, being bound to ten leopards, I mean a band of soldiers, who, even when they receive benefits, show themselves all the worse. But I am the more instructed by their injuries to act as a disciple of Christ; yet am I not thereby justified.\rMay I enjoy the wild beasts that are prepared for me; and I pray they may be found eager to rush upon me, which also I will entice to devour me speedily, and not deal with me as with some, whom, out of fear, they have not touched. But if they be unwilling to assail me, I will compel them to do so. Pardon me in this: I know what is for my benefit. Now I begin to be a disciple. And let no one, of things visible or invisible, envy me that I should attain to Jesus Christ. Let fire and the cross; let the crowds of wild beasts; let tearings, breakings, and dislocations of bones; let cutting off of members; let shatterings of the whole body; and let all the dreadful torments of the devil come upon me: only let me attain to Jesus Christ.\n6. By death I shall attain true life All the pleasures of the world, and all the kingdoms of this earth, shall profit me nothing. It is better for me to die on behalf of Jesus Christ, than to reign over all the ends of the earth. For what shall a man be profited, if he gain the whole world, but lose his own soul? Him I seek, who died for us: Him I desire, who rose again for our sake. This is the gain which is laid up for me. Pardon me, brethren: do not hinder me from living, do not wish to keep me in a state of death; and while I desire to belong to God, do not give me over to the world. Allow me to obtain pure light: when I have gone there, I shall indeed be a man of God. Permit me to be an imitator of the passion of my God. If any one has Him within himself, let him consider what I desire, and let him have sympathy with me, as knowing how I am straitened.\n7. Reason of desiring to die The prince of this world would fain carry me away, and corrupt my disposition towards God. Let none of you, therefore, who are in Rome help him; rather be on my side, that is, on the side of God. Do not speak of Jesus Christ, and yet set your desires on the world. Let not envy find a dwelling-place among you; nor even should I, when present with you, exhort you to it, be persuaded to listen to me, but rather give credit to those things which I now write to you. For though I am alive while I write to you, yet I am eager to die. My love has been crucified, and there is no fire in me desiring to be fed; but there is within me a water that lives and speaks, saying to me inwardly, Come to the Father. I have no delight in corruptible food, nor in the pleasures of this life. I desire the bread of God, the heavenly bread, the bread of life, which is the flesh of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who became afterwards of the seed of David and Abraham; and I desire the drink of God, namely His blood, which is incorruptible love and eternal life.\n8. Be favourable to me I no longer wish to live after the manner of men, and my desire shall be fulfilled if you consent. Be willing, then, that you also may have your desires fulfilled. I entreat you in this brief letter; give credit to me. Jesus Christ will reveal these things to you, so that you shall know that I speak truly. He is the mouth altogether free from falsehood, by which the Father has truly spoken. Pray for me, that I may attain the object of my desire. I have not written to you according to the flesh, but according to the will of God. If I shall suffer, you have wished well to me; but if I am rejected, you have hated me.\n9. Pray for the church in Syria Remember in your prayers the Church in Syria, which now has God for its shepherd, instead of me. Jesus Christ alone will oversee it, and your love will also regard it. But as for me, I am ashamed to be counted one of them; for indeed I am not worthy, as being the very last of them, and one born out of due time.\rBut I have obtained mercy to be somebody, if I shall attain to God. My spirit salutes you, and the love of the Churches that have received me in the name of Jesus Christ, and not as a mere passer-by. For even those Churches which were not near to me in the way, I mean according to the flesh, have gone before me, city by city, to meet me.\n10. Conclusion Now I write these things to you from Smyrna by the Ephesians, who are deservedly most happy. There is also with me, along with many others, Crocus, one dearly beloved by me. As to those who have gone before me from Syria to Rome for the glory of God, I believe that you are acquainted with them; to whom, then, make known that I am at hand. For they are all worthy, both of God and of you; and it is becoming that you should refresh them in all things. I have written these things unto you, on the day before the ninth of the Kalends of September (that is, on the twenty-third day of August). Fare well to the end, in the patience of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nSource   Translated by Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson. From Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. 1. Edited by Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson, and A. Cleveland Coxe.

Their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.\u0026rdquo;\nv16 Moses did so. According to all that Yahweh commanded him, so he did.\nv17 In the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was raised up.\nv18 Moses raised up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and raised up its pillars.\nv19 He spread the covering over the tent, and put the roof of the tabernacle above on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses.\nv20 He took and put the covenant into the ark, and set the poles on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark.\nv21 He brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the covenant, as Yahweh commanded Moses.\nv22 He put the table in the Tent of Meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside of the veil.\nv23 He set the bread in order on it before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.\nv24 He put the lamp stand in the Tent of Meeting, opposite the table, on the south side of the tabernacle.\nv25 He lit the lamps before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.\nv26 He put the golden altar in the Tent of Meeting before the veil;\nv27 and he burned incense of sweet spices on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses.\nv28 He put up the screen of the door to the tabernacle.\nv29 He set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering, as Yahweh commanded Moses.\nv30 He set the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water therein, with which to wash.\nv31 Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and their feet there.\nv32 When they went into the Tent of Meeting, and when they came near to the altar, they washed, as Yahweh commanded Moses.\nv33 He raised up the court around the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.\nv34 Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s glory filled the tabernacle.\nv35 Moses wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to enter into the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud stayed on it, and Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s glory filled the tabernacle.\nv36 When the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys;\nv37 but if the cloud wasn\u0026rsquo;t taken up, then they didn\u0026rsquo;t travel until the day that it was taken up.\nv38 For the cloud of Yahweh was on the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.\n","permalink":"https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/exodus/exod-40/","title":"Exodus 40"},{"content":"v1 In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was struck, in the same day, Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s hand was on me, and he brought me there.\nv2 In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain, on which was something like the frame of a city to the south.\nv3 He brought me there; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.\nv4 The man said to me, \u0026ldquo;Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I will show you; for you have been brought here so that I may show them to you. Declare all that you see to the house of Israel.\u0026rdquo;\nv5 Behold, there was a wall on the outside of the house all around, and in the man\u0026rsquo;s hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a hand width each. So he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.\nv6 Then he came to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up its steps. He measured the threshold of the gate, one reed wide; and the other threshold, one reed wide.\nv7 Every lodge was one reed long and one reed wide. Between the lodges was five cubits. The threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.\nv8 He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.\nv9 Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house.\nv10 The lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side. The three of them were of one measure. The posts had one measure on this side and on that side.\nv11 He measured the width of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;\nv12 and a border before the lodges, one cubit on this side, and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.\nv13 He measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits, door against door.\nv14 He also made posts, sixty cubits; and the court reached to the posts, around the gate.\nv15 From the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits.\nv16 There were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts within the gate all around, and likewise to the arches. Windows were around inward. Palm trees were on each post.\nv17 Then he brought me into the outer court. Behold, there were rooms and a pavement made for the court all around. Thirty rooms were on the pavement.\nv18 The pavement was by the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.\nv19 Then he measured the width from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside, one hundred cubits, both on the east and on the north.\nv20 He measured the length and width of the gate of the outer court which faces toward the north.\nv21 The lodges of it were three on this side and three on that side. Its posts and its arches were the same as the measure of the first gate: its length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.\nv22 Its windows, its arches, and its palm trees were the same as the measure of the gate which faces toward the east. They went up to it by seven steps. Its arches were before them.\nv23 There was a gate to the inner court facing the other gate, on the north and on the east. He measured one hundred cubits from gate to gate.\nv24 He led me toward the south; and behold, there was a gate toward the south. He measured its posts and its arches according to these measurements.\nv25 There were windows in it and in its arches all around, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.\nv26 There were seven steps to go up to it, and its arches were before them. It had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, on its posts.\nv27 There was a gate to the inner court toward the south. He measured one hundred cubits from gate to gate toward the south.\nv28 Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate. He measured the south gate according to these measurements;\nv29 with its lodges, its posts, and its arches, according to these measurements. There were windows in it and in its arches all around. It was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits wide.\nv30 There were arches all around, twenty-five cubits long, and five cubits wide.\nv31 Its arches were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts. The ascent to it had eight steps.\nv32 He brought me into the inner court toward the east. He measured the gate according to these measurements;\nv33 with its lodges, its posts, and its arches, according to these measurements. There were windows in it and in its arches all around. It was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits wide.\nv34 Its arches were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts on this side and on that side. The ascent to it had eight steps.\nv35 He brought me to the north gate, and he measured it according to these measurements;\nv36 its lodges, its posts, and its arches. There were windows in it all around. The length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits.\nv37 Its posts were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts on this side and on that side. The ascent to it had eight steps.\nv38 A room with its door was by the posts at the gates. They washed the burnt offering there.\nv39 In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, on which to kill the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.\nv40 On the one side outside, as one goes up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.\nv41 Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate: eight tables, on which they killed the sacrifices.\nv42 There were four tables for the burnt offering, of cut stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high. They laid the instruments with which they killed the burnt offering and the sacrifice on them.\nv43 The hooks, a hand width long, were fastened within all around. The meat of the offering was on the tables.\nv44 Outside of the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate. They faced toward the south. One at the side of the east gate faced toward the north.\nv45 He said to me, \u0026ldquo;This room, which faces toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the duty of the house.\nv46 The room which faces toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the duty of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Yahweh to minister to him.\u0026rdquo;\nv47 He measured the court, one hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits wide, square. The altar was before the house.\nv48 Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side. The width of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side.\nv49 The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; even by the steps by which they went up to it. There were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.\n","permalink":"https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/ezekiel/ezek-40/","title":"Ezekiel 40"},{"content":"v1 He brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits wide on the one side, and six cubits wide on the other side, which was the width of the tent.\nv2 The width of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side. He measured its length, forty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits.\nv3 Then he went inward and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the width of the entrance, seven cubits.\nv4 He measured its length, twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, before the temple. He said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the most holy place.\u0026rdquo;\nv5 Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the width of every side room, four cubits, all around the house on every side.\nv6 The side rooms were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order. They entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side rooms all around, that they might be supported, and not penetrate the wall of the house.\nv7 The side rooms were wider on the higher levels, because the walls were narrower at the higher levels. Therefore the width of the house increased upward; and so one went up from the lowest level to the highest through the middle level.\nv8 I saw also that the house had a raised base all around. The foundations of the side rooms were a full reed of six great cubits.\nv9 The thickness of the wall, which was for the side rooms, on the outside, was five cubits. That which was left was the place of the side rooms that belonged to the house.\nv10 Between the rooms was a width of twenty cubits around the house on every side.\nv11 The doors of the side rooms were toward an open area that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south. The width of the open area was five cubits all around.\nv12 The building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.\nv13 So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with its walls, one hundred cubits long;\nv14 also the width of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, one hundred cubits.\nv15 He measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back, and its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits from the inner temple, and the porches of the court\nv16 the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries around on their three stories, opposite the threshold, with wood ceilings all around, and from the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered),\nv17 to the space above the door, even to the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall all around inside and outside, by measure.\nv18 It was made with cherubim and palm trees. A palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;\nv19 so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. It was made like this through all the house all around.\nv20 Cherubim and palm trees were made from the ground to above the door. The wall of the temple was like this.\nv21 As for the temple, the door posts were squared. As for the face of the sanctuary, its appearance was as the appearance of the temple.\nv22 The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits. Its corners, its length, and its walls were of wood. He said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the table that is before Yahweh.\u0026rdquo;\nv23 The temple and the sanctuary had two doors.\nv24 The doors had two leaves each, two turning leaves: two for the one door, and two leaves for the other.\nv25 There were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, like those made on the walls. There was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside.\nv26 There were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch.

Therefore the uppermost was set back more than the lowest and the middle from the ground.\nv7 The wall that was outside by the side of the rooms, toward the outer court before the rooms, its length was fifty cubits.\nv8 For the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits.

There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.\nv55 When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, \u0026ldquo;Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.\u0026rdquo;\nv56 The famine was over all the surface of the earth. Joseph opened all the store houses, and sold to the Egyptians.

Praise of the bishop Which bishop, I know, obtained the ministry which pertains to the common good, not of himself, neither by men, Galatians 1:1 nor through vainglory, but by the love of God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ; at whose meekness I am struck with admiration, and who by his silence is able to accomplish more than those who vainly talk. For he is in harmony with the commandments of God, even as the harp is with its strings. Wherefore my soul declares his mind towards God a happy one, knowing it to be virtuous and perfect, and that his stability as well as freedom from all anger is after the example of the infinite meekness of the living God.\n2. Maintain union with the bishop Wherefore, as children of light and truth, flee from division and wicked doctrines; but where the shepherd is, there follow as sheep. For there are many wolves that appear worthy of credit, who, by means of a pernicious pleasure, carry captive 2 Timothy 3:6 those that are running towards God; but in your unity they shall have no place.\n3. Avoid schismatics Keep yourselves from those evil plants which Jesus Christ does not tend, because they are not the planting of the Father. Not that I have found any division among you, but exceeding purity. For as many as are of God and of Jesus Christ are also with the bishop. And as many as shall, in the exercise of repentance, return into the unity of the Church, these, too, shall belong to God, that they may live according to Jesus Christ. Do not err, my brethren. If any man follows him that makes a schism in the Church, he shall not inherit the kingdom of God. If any one walks according to a strange opinion, he agrees not with the passion of Christ..\n4. Have but one Eucharist, etc. Take heed, then, to have but one Eucharist. For there is one flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ, and one cup to show forth the unity of His blood; one altar; as there is one bishop, along with the presbytery and deacons, my fellow-servants: that so, whatsoever you do, you may do it according to the will of God.\n5. Pray for me My brethren, I am greatly enlarged in loving you; and rejoicing exceedingly over you, I seek to secure your safety. Yet it is not I, but Jesus Christ, for whose sake being bound I fear the more, inasmuch as I am not yet perfect. But your prayer to God shall make me perfect, that I may attain to that portion which through mercy has been allotted me, while I flee to the Gospel as to the flesh of Jesus, and to the apostles as to the presbytery of the Church. And let us also love the prophets, because they too have proclaimed the Gospel, and placed their hope in Him, and waited for Him; in whom also believing, they were saved, through union to Jesus Christ, being holy men, worthy of love and admiration, having had witness borne to them by Jesus Christ, and being reckoned along with us in the Gospel of the common hope.\n6. Do not accept Judaism But if any one preach the Jewish law unto you, listen not to him. For it is better to hearken to Christian doctrine from a man who has been circumcised, than to Judaism from one uncircumcised. But if either of such persons do not speak concerning Jesus Christ, they are in my judgment but as monuments and sepulchres of the dead, upon which are written only the names of men. Flee therefore the wicked devices and snares of the prince of this world, lest at any time being conquered by his artifices, grow weak in your love. But be all joined together with an undivided heart. And I thank my God that I have a good conscience in respect to you, and that no one has it in his power to boast, either privately or publicly, that I have burdened any one either in much or in little. And I wish for all among whom I have spoken, that they may not possess that for a testimony against them.\n7. I have exhorted you to unity For though some would have deceived me according to the flesh, yet the Spirit, as being from God, is not deceived. For it knows both whence it comes and whither it goes, John 3:8 and detects the secrets of the heart. For, when I was among you, I cried, I spoke with a loud voice: Give heed to the bishop, and to the presbytery and deacons. Now, some suspected me of having spoken thus, as knowing beforehand the division caused by some among you. But He is my witness, for whose sake I am in bonds, that I got no intelligence from any man. But the Spirit proclaimed these words: Do nothing without the bishop; keep your bodies as the temples of God; love unity; avoid divisions; be the followers of Jesus Christ, even as He is of His Father.\n8. The same continued I therefore did what belonged to me, as a man devoted to unity. For where there is division and wrath, God does not dwell. To all them that repent, the Lord grants forgiveness, if they turn in penitence to the unity of God, and to communion with the bishop. I trust as to you in the grace of Jesus Christ, who shall free you from every bond. And I exhort you to do nothing out of strife, but according to the doctrine of Christ. When I heard some saying, If I do not find it in the ancient Scriptures, I will not believe the Gospel; on my saying to them, It is written, they answered me, That remains to be proved. But to me Jesus Christ is in the place of all that is ancient: His cross, and death, and resurrection, and the faith which is by Him, are undefiled monuments of antiquity; by which I desire, through your prayers, to be justified.\n9. The Old Testament is good: the New Testament is better The priests indeed are good, but the High Priest is better; to whom the holy of holies has been committed, and who alone has been trusted with the secrets of God. He is the door of the Father, by which enter in Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the prophets, and the apostles, and the Church. All these have for their object the attaining to the unity of God. But the Gospel possesses something transcendent above the former dispensation, viz., the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ, His passion and resurrection. For the beloved prophets announced Him, but the Gospel is the perfection of immortality. All these things are good together, if you believe in love.\n10. Congratulate the Antiochans on the close of the persecution Since, according to your prayers, and the compassion which you feel in Christ Jesus, it is reported to me that the Church which is at Antioch in Syria possesses peace, it will become you, as a Church of God, to elect a deacon to act as the ambassador of God for you to the brethren there, that he may rejoice along with them when they are met together, and glorify the name of God. Blessed is he in Jesus Christ, who shall be deemed worthy of such a ministry; and you too shall be glorified. And if you are willing, it is not beyond your power to do this, for the sake of God; as also the nearest Churches have sent, in some cases bishops, and in others presbyters and deacons.\n11. Thanks and salutation Now, as to Philo the deacon, of Cilicia, a man of reputation, who still ministers to me in the word of God, along with Rheus Agathopus, an elect man, who has followed me from Syria, not regarding his life — these bear witness in your behalf; and I myself give thanks to God for you, that you have received them, even as the Lord you. But may those that dishonoured them be forgiven through the grace of Jesus Christ! The love of the brethren at Troas salutes you; whence also I write to you by Burrhus, who was sent along with me by the Ephesians and Smyrnæans, to show their respect. May the Lord Jesus Christ honour them, in whom they hope, in flesh, and soul, and faith, and love, and concord! Fare well in Christ Jesus, our common hope.\nSources  Translated by Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson. From Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. 1. Edited by Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson, and A.

The Egyptians wept for Israel for seventy days.\nv4 When the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s staff, saying, \u0026ldquo;If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,\nv5 \u0026lsquo;My father made me swear, saying, \u0026ldquo;Behold, I am dying. Bury me in my grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan.\u0026rdquo; Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come again.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nv6 Pharaoh said, \u0026ldquo;Go up, and bury your father, just like he made you swear.\u0026rdquo;\nv7 Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, all the elders of the land of Egypt,\nv8 all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father\u0026rsquo;s house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.\nv9 Both chariots and horsemen went up with him. It was a very great company.\nv10 They came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation. He mourned for his father seven days.\nv11 When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, \u0026ldquo;This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.\u0026rdquo; Therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.\nv12 His sons did to him just as he commanded them,\nv13 for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, as a possession for a burial site, from Ephron the Hittite, near Mamre.\nv14 Joseph returned into Egypt\u0026ndash;he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.\nv15 When Joseph\u0026rsquo;s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, \u0026ldquo;It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all the evil which we did to him.\u0026rdquo;\nv16 They sent a message to Joseph, saying, \u0026ldquo;Your father commanded before he died, saying,\nv17 \u0026lsquo;You shall tell Joseph, \u0026ldquo;Now please forgive the disobedience of your brothers, and their sin, because they did evil to you.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; Now, please forgive the disobedience of the servants of the God of your father.\u0026rdquo; Joseph wept when they spoke to him.\nv18 His brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, \u0026ldquo;Behold, we are your servants.\u0026rdquo;\nv19 Joseph said to them, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid, for am I in the place of God?\nv20 As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to save many people alive, as is happening today.\nv21 Now therefore don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid.

Joseph lived one hundred ten years.\nv23 Joseph saw Ephraim\u0026rsquo;s children to the third generation. The children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born on Joseph\u0026rsquo;s knees.\nv24 Joseph said to his brothers, \u0026ldquo;I am dying, but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\u0026rdquo;\nv25 Joseph took an oath from the children of Israel, saying, \u0026ldquo;God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.\u0026rdquo;\nv26 So Joseph died, being one hundred ten years old, and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\n","permalink":"https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/genesis/gen-50/","title":"Genesis 50"},{"content":"v1 Yahweh says, \u0026ldquo;Where is the bill of your mother\u0026rsquo;s divorce, with which I have put her away?

Make the watch strong! Set the watchmen, and prepare the ambushes; for Yahweh has both purposed and done that which he spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.\nv13 You who dwell on many waters, abundant in treasures, your end has come, the measure of your covetousness.\nv14 Yahweh of Armies has sworn by himself, saying, \u0026lsquo;Surely I will fill you with men, as with the canker worm; and they will lift up a shout against you.\u0026rsquo;\nv15 \u0026ldquo;He has made the earth by his power.

All her slain will fall in the middle of her.\nv48 Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, will sing for joy over Babylon; for the destroyers will come to her from the north,\u0026rdquo; says Yahweh.\nv49 \u0026ldquo;As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, so the slain of all the land will fall at Babylon.\nv50 You who have escaped the sword, go!

He reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother\u0026rsquo;s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.\nv2 He did that which was evil in Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s sight, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.\nv3 For through Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s anger this happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.\nv4 In the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.\nv5 So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.\nv6 In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.\nv7 Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king\u0026rsquo;s garden. Now the Chaldeans were against the city all around. The men of war went toward the Arabah,\nv8 but the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.\nv9 Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgment on him.\nv10 The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. He also killed all the princes of Judah in Riblah.\nv11 He put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison until the day of his death.\nv12 Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem.\nv13 He burned Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s house, and the king\u0026rsquo;s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, he burned with fire.\nv14 All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around.\nv15 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude.\nv16 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vineyard keepers and farmers.\nv17 The Chaldeans broke the pillars of bronze that were in Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s house, and the bases and the bronze sea that were in Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s house in pieces, and carried all of their bronze to Babylon.\nv18 They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered.\nv19 The captain of the guard took away the cups, the fire pans, the basins, the pots, the lamp stands, the spoons, and the bowls; that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver.\nv20 They took the two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s house. The bronze of all these vessels was without weight.\nv21 As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits encircled it; and its thickness was four fingers. It was hollow.\nv22 A capital of bronze was on it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital all around, all of bronze: and the second pillar also had like these, and pomegranates.\nv23 There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were one hundred on the network all around.\nv24 The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:\nv25 and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and seven men of those who saw the king\u0026rsquo;s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the middle of the city.\nv26 Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.\nv27 The king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.\nv28 This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year, three thousand twenty-three Jews;\nv29 in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-two persons;\nv30 in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty-five people: all the people were four thousand six hundred.\nv31 In the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and released him from prison.\nv32 He spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon,\nv33 and changed his prison garments.

He didn\u0026rsquo;t spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,\nv51 and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.\nv52 But he led out his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.\nv53 He led them safely, so that they weren\u0026rsquo;t afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.\nv54 He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.\nv55 He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.\nv56 Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and didn\u0026rsquo;t keep his testimonies,\nv57 but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were twisted like a deceitful bow.\nv58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.\nv59 When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel,\nv60 so that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men,\nv61 and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into the adversary\u0026rsquo;s hand.\nv62 He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance.\nv63 Fire devoured their young men. Their virgins had no wedding song.\nv64 Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn\u0026rsquo;t weep.\nv65 Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.\nv66 He struck his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach.\nv67 Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn\u0026rsquo;t choose the tribe of Ephraim,\nv68 But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved.\nv69 He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever.\nv70 He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;\nv71 from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.\nv72 So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.\n","permalink":"https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/psalm/ps-78/","title":"Psalm 78"},{"content":"v1 God, the nations have come into your inheritance.

For who ever dwelt even for a short time among you, and did not find your faith to be as fruitful of virtue as it was firmly established? Who did not admire the sobriety and moderation of your godliness in Christ? Who did not proclaim the magnificence of your habitual hospitality? And who did not rejoice over your perfect and well-grounded knowledge? For you did all things without respect of persons, and walked in the commandments of God, being obedient to those who had the rule over you, and giving all fitting honour to the presbyters among you. You enjoined young men to be of a sober and serious mind, you instructed your wives to do all things with a blameless, becoming, and pure conscience, loving their husbands as in duty bound; and you taught them that, living in the rule of obedience, they should manage their household affairs becomingly, and be in every respect marked by discretion.\n2. Praise of the Corinthians Continued. Moreover, you were all distinguished by humility, and were in no respect puffed up with pride, but yielded obedience rather than extorted it, and were more willing to give than to receive.\rContent with the provision which God had made for you, and carefully attending to His words, you were inwardly filled with His doctrine, and His sufferings were before your eyes. Thus a profound and abundant peace was given to you all, and you had an insatiable desire for doing good, while a full outpouring of the Holy Spirit was upon you all. Full of holy designs, you did, with true earnestness of mind and a godly confidence, stretch forth your hands to God Almighty, beseeching Him to be merciful unto you, if you had been guilty of any involuntary transgression. Day and night you were anxious for the whole brotherhood\r, that the number of God\u0026rsquo;s elect might be saved with mercy and a good conscience. You were sincere and uncorrupted, and forgetful of injuries between one another. Every kind of faction and schism was abominable in your sight. You mourned over the transgressions of your neighbours: their deficiencies you deemed your own. You never grudged any act of kindness, being ready to every good work.\rAdorned by a thoroughly virtuous and religious life, you did all things in the fear of God. The commandments and ordinances of the Lord were written upon the tablets of your hearts.\r3. The Sad State of the Corinthian Church After Sedition Arose in It from Envy and Emulation. Every kind of honour and happiness was bestowed upon you, and then was fulfilled that which is written, My beloved ate and drank, and was enlarged and became fat, and kicked.\rHence flowed emulation and envy, strife and sedition, persecution and disorder, war and captivity. So the worthless rose up against the honoured, those of no reputation against such as were renowned, the foolish against the wise, the young against those advanced in years. For this reason righteousness and peace are now far departed from you, inasmuch as every one abandons the fear of God, and has become blind in His faith, neither walks in the ordinances of His appointment, nor acts a part becoming a Christian, but walks after his own wicked lusts, resuming the practice of an unrighteous and ungodly envy, by which death itself entered into the world.\r4. Many Evils Have Already Flowed from This Source in Ancient Times. For thus it is written: And it came to pass after certain days, that Cain brought of the fruits of the earth a sacrifice unto God; and Abel also brought of the firstlings of his sheep, and of the fat thereof. And God had respect to Abel and to his offerings, but Cain and his sacrifices He did not regard. And Cain was deeply grieved, and his countenance fell. And God said to Cain, Why are you grieved, and why is your countenance fallen? If you offer rightly, but do not divide rightly, have you not sinned? Be at peace: your offering returns to yourself, and you shall again possess it. And Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go into the field. And it came to pass, while they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. You see, brethren, how envy and jealousy led to the murder of a brother. Through envy, also, our father Jacob fled from the face of Esau his brother. Envy made Joseph be persecuted unto death, and to come into bondage. Genesis xxxvii Envy compelled Moses to flee from the face of Pharaoh king of Egypt, when he heard these words from his fellow-countryman, Who made you a judge or a ruler over us? Will you kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?\rOn account of envy, Aaron and Miriam had to make their abode without the camp.\rEnvy brought down Dathan and Abiram alive to Hades, through the sedition which they excited against God\u0026rsquo;s servant Moses.\rThrough envy, David not only underwent the hatred of foreigners, but was also persecuted by Saul king of Israel.\n5. The Martyrdom of Peter and Paul. But not to dwell upon ancient examples, let us come to the most recent spiritual heroes. Let us take the noble examples furnished in our own generation. Through envy and jealousy the greatest and most righteous pillars of the church have been persecuted and put to death. Let us set before our eyes the illustrious apostles. Peter, through unrighteous envy, endured not one or two, but numerous labours; and when he had at length suffered martyrdom, departed to the place of glory due to him. Owing to envy, Paul also obtained the reward of patient endurance, after being seven times thrown into captivity, compelled to flee, and stoned. After preaching both in the east and west, he gained the illustrious reputation due to his faith, having taught righteousness to the whole world, and come to the extreme limit of the west, and suffered martyrdom under the prefects. Thus was he removed from the world, and went into the holy place, having proved himself a striking example of patience.\n6. Continuation. Several Other Martyrs. To these men who spent their lives in the practice of holiness, there is to be added a great multitude of the elect, who, having through envy endured many indignities and tortures, furnished us with a most excellent example. Through envy, those women, the Danaids and Dircæ, being persecuted, after they had suffered terrible and unspeakable torments, finished the course of their faith with steadfastness, and though weak in body, received a noble reward. Envy has alienated wives from their husbands, and changed that saying of our father Adam, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.\rEnvy and strife have overthrown great cities, and rooted up mighty nations.\n7. An Exhortation to Repentance. These things, beloved, we write unto you, not merely to admonish you of your duty, but also to remind ourselves. For we are struggling on the same arena, and the same conflict is assigned to both of us. Wherefore let us give up vain and fruitless cares, and approach to the glorious and venerable rule of our holy calling. Let us attend to what is good, pleasing, and acceptable in the sight of Him who formed us. Let us look steadfastly to the blood of Christ, and see how precious that blood is to God which, having been shed for our salvation, has set the grace of repentance before the whole world. Let us turn to every age that has passed, and learn that, from generation to generation, the Lord has granted a place of repentance to all such as would be converted unto Him. Noah preached repentance, and as many as listened to him were saved. Jonah proclaimed destruction to the Ninevites; Jonah iii but they, repenting of their sins, propitiated God by prayer, and obtained salvation, although they were aliens to the covenant of God.\n8. Continuation Of Repentance. The ministers of the grace of God have, by the Holy Spirit, spoken of repentance; and the Lord of all things has himself declared with an oath regarding it, As I live, says the Lord, I desire not the death of the sinner, but rather his repentance\r; adding, moreover, this gracious declaration, Repent, O house of Israel, of your iniquity.\rSay to the children of my people, Though your sins reach from earth to heaven, and though they be redder\rthan scarlet, and blacker than sack-cloth, yet if you turn to me with your whole heart, and say, Father! I will listen to you, as to a holy people. And in another place He speaks thus: \u0026ldquo;Wash you and become clean; put away the wickedness of your souls from before my eyes; cease from your evil ways, and learn to do well; seek out judgment, deliver the oppressed, judge the fatherless, and see that justice is done to the widow; and come, and let us reason together. He declares, Though your sins be like crimson, I will make them white as snow; though they be like scarlet, I will whiten them like wool. And if you be willing and obey me, you shall eat the good of the land; but if you refuse, and will not hearken unto me, the sword shall devour you, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken these things.\u0026quot;Psalm 51\rDesiring, therefore, that all His beloved should be partakers of repentance, He has, by His almighty will, established these declarations.\n9. Examples of the Saints. Wherefore, let us yield obedience to His excellent and glorious will; and imploring His mercy and loving-kindness, while we forsake all fruitless labours and strife, and envy, which leads to death, let us turn and have recourse to His compassions. Let us steadfastly contemplate those who have perfectly ministered to his excellent glory. Let us take (for instance) Enoch, who, being found righteous in obedience, was translated, and death was never known to happen to him. Noah, being found faithful, preached regeneration to the world through his ministry; and the Lord saved by him the animals which, with one accord, entered into the ark.\n10. Continuation of the Above. Abraham, styled the friend, was found faithful, inasmuch as he rendered obedience to the words of God. He, in the exercise of obedience, went out from his own country, and from his kindred, and from his father\u0026rsquo;s house, in order that, by forsaking a small territory, and a weak family, and an insignificant house, he might inherit the promises of God. For God said to him, Get you out from your country, and from your kindred, and from your father\u0026rsquo;s house, into the land which I shall show you. And I will make you a great nation, and will bless you, and make your name great, and you shall be blessed. And I will bless them that bless you, and curse them that curse you; and in you shall all the families of the earth be blessed. Genesis 12:1-3 And again, on his departing from Lot, God said to him, Lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you now are, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward; for all the land which you see, to you will I give it, and to your seed forever. And I will make your seed as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall your seed also be numbered. Genesis 13:14-16 And again the Scripture says, God brought forth Abram, and spoke unto him, Look up now to heaven, and count the stars if you are able to number them; so shall your seed be. And Abram believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness. On account of his faith and hospitality, a son was given him in his old age; and in the exercise of obedience, he offered him as a sacrifice to God on one of the mountains which He showed him.\n11. Continuation. Lot. On account of his hospitality and godliness, Lot was saved out of Sodom when all the country round was punished by means of fire and brimstone, the Lord thus making it manifest that He does not forsake those that hope in Him, but gives up such as depart from Him to punishment and torture. Genesis xix; cf. 2 Peter 2:6-9 For Lot\u0026rsquo;s wife, who went forth with him, being of a different mind from himself, and not continuing in agreement with him as to the command which had been given them, was made an example of, so as to be a pillar of salt unto this day. This was done that all might know that those who are of a double mind, and who distrust the power of God, bring down judgment on themselves and become a sign to all succeeding generations.\n12. The Rewards of Faith and Hospitality. Rahab. On account of her faith and hospitality, Rahab the harlot was saved. For when spies were sent by Joshua, the son of Nun, to Jericho, the king of the country ascertained that they had come to spy out their land, and sent men to seize them, in order that, when taken, they might be put to death. But the hospitable Rahab receiving them, concealed them on the roof of her house under some stalks of flax. And when the men sent by the king arrived and said, There came men unto you who are to spy out our land; bring them forth, for so the king commands, she answered them, The two men whom you seek came unto me, but quickly departed again and are gone, thus not discovering the spies to them. Then she said to the men, I know assuredly that the Lord your God has given you this city, for the fear and dread of you have fallen on its inhabitants. When therefore you shall have taken it, keep ye me and the house of my father in safety. And they said to her, It shall be as you have spoken to us. As soon, therefore, as you know that we are at hand, you shall gather all your family under your roof, and they shall be preserved, but all that are found outside of your dwelling shall perish. Moreover, they gave her a sign to this effect, that she should hang forth from her house a scarlet thread. And thus they made it manifest that redemption should flow through the blood of the Lord to all them that believe and hope in God. You see, beloved, that there was not only faith, but prophecy, in this woman.\n13. An Exhortation to Humility. Let us therefore, brethren, be of humble mind, laying aside all haughtiness, and pride, and foolishness, and angry feelings; and let us act according to that which is written (for the Holy Spirit says, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, neither let the rich man glory in his riches; but let him that glories glory in the Lord, in diligently seeking Him, and doing judgment and righteousness ), being especially mindful of the words of the Lord Jesus which He spoke teaching us meekness and long-suffering. For thus He spoke: Be merciful, that you may obtain mercy; forgive, that it may be forgiven to you; as you do, so shall it be done unto you; as you judge, so shall you be judged; as you are kind, so shall kindness be shown to you; with what measure you measure, with the same it shall be measured to you. By this precept and by these rules let us establish ourselves, that we walk with all humility in obedience to His holy words. For the holy word says, On whom shall I look, but on him that is meek and peaceable, and that trembles at my words? Isaiah 66:2\n14. We Should Obey God Rather Than the Authors of Sedition. It is right and holy therefore, men and brethren, rather to obey God than to follow those who, through pride and sedition, have become the leaders of a detestable emulation. For we shall incur no slight injury, but rather great danger, if we rashly yield ourselves to the inclinations of men who aim at exciting strife and tumults, so as to draw us away from what is good. Let us be kind one to another after the pattern of the tender mercy and benignity of our Creator. For it is written, The kind-hearted shall inhabit the land, and the guiltless shall be left upon it, but transgressors shall be destroyed from off the face of it. Proverbs 2:21-22 And again the Scripture says, I saw the ungodly highly exalted, and lifted up like the cedars of Lebanon: I passed by, and, behold, he was not; and I diligently sought his place, and could not find it. Preserve innocence, and look on equity: for there shall be a remnant to the peaceable man.\n15. We Must Adhere to Those Who Cultivate Peace, Not to Those Who Merely Pretend to Do So. Let us cleave, therefore, to those who cultivate peace with godliness, and not to those who hypocritically profess to desire it. For the Scripture says in a certain place, This people honours me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. And again: They bless with their mouth, but curse with their heart. And again it says, They loved Him with their mouth, and lied to Him with their tongue; but their heart was not right with Him, neither were they faithful in His covenant. Let the deceitful lips become silent, and let the Lord destroy all the lying lips, and the boastful tongue of those who have said, Let us magnify our tongue: our lips are our own; who is lord over us? For the oppression of the poor, and for the sighing of the needy, will I now arise, says the Lord: I will place him in safety; I will deal confidently with him.\n16. Christ as an Example of Humility. For Christ is of those who are humble-minded, and not of those who exalt themselves over His flock. Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Sceptre of the majesty of God, did not come in the pomp of pride or arrogance, although He might have done so, but in a lowly condition, as the Holy Spirit had declared regarding Him. For He says, Lord, who has believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We have declared our message in His presence: He is, as it were, a child, and like a root in thirsty ground; He has no form nor glory, yea, we saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness; but His form was without eminence, yea, deficient in comparison with the ordinary form of men. He is a man exposed to stripes and suffering, and acquainted with the endurance of grief: for His countenance was turned away; He was despised, and not esteemed. He bears our iniquities, and is in sorrow for our sakes; yet we supposed that on His own account He was exposed to labour, and stripes, and affliction. But He was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we were healed. All we, like sheep, have gone astray; every man has wandered in his own way; and the Lord has delivered Him up for our sins, while He in the midst of His sufferings opens not His mouth. He was brought as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before her shearer is dumb, so He opens not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away; who shall declare His generation? For His life is taken from the earth. For the transgressions of my people was He brought down to death. And I will give the wicked for His sepulchre, and the rich for His death, because He did no iniquity, neither was guile found in His mouth. And the Lord is pleased to purify him by stripes. If you make an offering for sin, your soul shall see a long-lived seed. And the Lord is pleased to relieve Him of the affliction of His soul, to show Him light, and to form Him with understanding, to justify the Just One who ministers well to many; and He Himself shall carry their sins. On this account He shall inherit many, and shall divide the spoil of the strong; because His soul was delivered to death, and He was reckoned among the transgressors, and He bare the sins of many, and for their sins was He delivered. And again He says, I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people. All that see me have derided me; they have spoken with their lips; they have wagged their head, saying He hoped in God, let Him deliver Him, let Him save Him, since He delights in Him. You see, beloved, what is the example which has been given us; for if the Lord thus humbled Himself, what shall we do who have through Him come under the yoke of His grace?\n17. The Saints as Examples of Humility. Let us be imitators also of those who in goat-skins and sheep-skins Hebrews 11:37 went about proclaiming the coming of Christ; I mean Elijah, Elisha, and Ezekiel among the prophets, with those others to whom a like testimony is borne in Scripture. Abraham was specially honoured, and was called the friend of God; yet he, earnestly regarding the glory of God, humbly declared, I am but dust and ashes. Genesis 18:27 Moreover, it is thus written of Job, Job was a righteous man, and blameless, truthful, God-fearing, and one that kept himself from all evil. Job 1:1 But bringing an accusation against himself, he said, No man is free from defilement, even if his life be but of one day. Job 14:4-5 Moses was called faithful in all God\u0026rsquo;s house; and through his instrumentality, God punished Egypt with plagues and tortures. Yet he, though thus greatly honoured, did not adopt lofty language, but said, when the divine oracle came to him out of the bush, Who am I, that You send me? I am a man of a feeble voice and a slow tongue. And again he said, I am but as the smoke of a pot.\n18. David as an Example of Humility. But what shall we say concerning David, to whom such testimony was borne, and of whom God said, I have found a man after my own heart, David the son of Jesse; and in everlasting mercy have I anointed him? Yet this very man says to God, Have mercy on me, O Lord, according to Your great mercy; and according to the multitude of Your compassions, blot out my transgression. Wash me still more from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge mine iniquity, and my sin is ever before me. Against You only have I sinned, and done that which is evil in Your sight; that You may be justified in Your sayings, and may overcome when You are judged. For, behold, I was conceived in transgressions, and in sins did my mother conceive me. For, behold, You have loved truth; the secret and hidden things of wisdom have You shown me. You shall sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed; You shall wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. You shall make me to hear joy and gladness; my bones, which have been humbled, shall exult. Turn away Your face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from Your presence, and take not Your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and establish me by Your governing Spirit. I will teach transgressors Your ways, and the ungodly shall be converted unto You. Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation: my tongue shall exult in Your righteousness. O Lord, You shall open my mouth, and my lips shall show forth Your praise. For if You had desired sacrifice, I would have given it; You will not delight in burnt-offerings. The sacrifice acceptable to God is a bruised spirit; a broken and a contrite heart God will not despise.\n19. Imitating These Examples, Let Us Seek After Peace. Thus the humility and godly submission of so great and illustrious men have rendered not only us, but also all the generations before us, better; even as many as have received His oracles in fear and truth. Wherefore, having so many great and glorious examples set before us, let us turn again to the practice of that peace which from the beginning was the mark set before us; and let us look steadfastly to the Father and Creator of the universe, and cleave to His mighty and surpassingly great gifts and benefactions of peace. Let us contemplate Him with our understanding, and look with the eyes of our soul to His long-suffering will. Let us reflect how free from the wrath He is towards all His creation.\n20. The Peace and Harmony of the Universe. The heavens, revolving under His government, are subject to Him in peace. Day and night run the course appointed by Him, in no wise hindering each other. The sun and moon, with the companies of the stars, roll on in harmony according to His command, within their prescribed limits, and without any deviation. The fruitful earth, according to His will, brings forth food in abundance, at the proper seasons, for man and beast and all the living beings upon it, never hesitating, nor changing any of the ordinances which He has fixed. The unsearchable places of abysses, and the indescribable arrangements of the lower world, are restrained by the same laws. The vast unmeasurable sea, gathered together by His working into various basins, never passes beyond the bounds placed around it, but does as He has commanded. For He said, Thus far shall you come, and your waves shall be broken within you. Job 38:11 The ocean, impassable to man and the worlds beyond it, are regulated by the same enactments of the Lord. The seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, peacefully give place to one another. The winds in their several quarters fulfil, at the proper time, their service without hindrance. The ever-flowing fountains, formed both for enjoyment and health, furnish without fail their breasts for the life of men. The very smallest of living beings meet together in peace and concord. All these the great Creator and Lord of all has appointed to exist in peace and harmony; while He does good to all, but most abundantly to us who have fled for refuge to His compassions through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom be glory and majesty for ever and ever. Amen.\n21. Let Us Obey God, and Not the Authors of Sedition. Take heed, beloved, lest His many kindnesses lead to the condemnation of us all. For thus it must be unless we walk worthy of Him, and with one mind do those things which are good and well-pleasing in His sight. For the Scripture says in a certain place, The Spirit of the Lord is a candle searching the secret parts of the belly. Proverbs 20:27 Let us reflect how near He is, and that none of the thoughts or reasonings in which we engage are hid from Him. It is right, therefore, that we should not leave the post which His will has assigned us. Let us rather offend those men who are foolish, and inconsiderate, and lifted up, and who glory in the pride of their speech, than offend God. Let us reverence the Lord Jesus Christ, whose blood was given for us; let us esteem those who have the rule over us; let us honour the aged among us; let us train up the young men in the fear of God; let us direct our wives to that which is good. Let them exhibit the lovely habit of purity in all their conduct; let them show forth the sincere disposition of meekness; let them make manifest the command which they have of their tongue, by their manner of speaking; let them display their love, not by preferring one to another, but by showing equal affection to all that piously fear God. Let your children be partakers of true Christian training; let them learn of how great avail humility is with God — how much the spirit of pure affection can prevail with Him — how excellent and great His fear is, and how it saves all those who walk in it with a pure mind. For He is a Searcher of the thoughts and desires of the heart: His breath is in us; and when He pleases, He will take it away.\n22. These Exhortations are Confirmed by the Christian Faith, Which Proclaims the Misery of Sinful Conduct. Now the faith which is in Christ confirms all these admonitions. For He Himself by the Holy Ghost thus addresses us: Come, you children, hearken unto me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord. What man is he that desires life, and loves to see good days? Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking guile. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and His ears are open unto their prayers. The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. The righteous cried, and the Lord heard him, and delivered him out of all his troubles. Many are the stripes appointed for the wicked; but mercy shall compass those about who hope in the Lord.\n23. Be Humble, and Believe that Christ Will Come Again. The all-merciful and beneficent Father has bowels of compassion towards those that fear Him, and kindly and lovingly bestows His favours upon those who come to Him with a simple mind. Wherefore let us not be double-minded; neither let our soul be lifted up on account of His exceedingly great and glorious gifts. Far from us be that which is written, Wretched are they who are of a double mind, and of a doubting heart; who say, These things we have heard even in the times of our fathers; but, behold, we have grown old, and none of them has happened unto us; You foolish ones! compare yourselves to a tree; take for instance the vine. First of all, it sheds its leaves, then it buds, next it puts forth leaves, and then it flowers; after that comes the sour grape, and then follows the ripened fruit. You perceive how in a little time the fruit of a tree comes to maturity. Of a truth, soon and suddenly shall His will be accomplished, as the Scripture also bears witness, saying, Speedily will He come, and will not tarry; and, The Lord shall suddenly come to His temple, even the Holy One, for whom you look. Malachi 3:1\n24. God Continually Shows Us in Nature that There Will Be a Resurrection. Let us consider, beloved, how the Lord continually proves to us that there shall be a future resurrection, of which He has rendered the Lord Jesus Christ the first-fruits by raising Him from the dead. Let us contemplate, beloved, the resurrection which is at all times taking place. Day and night declare to us a resurrection. The night sinks to sleep, and the day arises; the day again departs, and the night comes on. Let us behold the fruits of the earth, how the sowing of grain takes place. The sower Luke 8:5 goes forth, and casts it into the ground, and the seed being thus scattered, though dry and naked when it fell upon the earth, is gradually dissolved. Then out of its dissolution the mighty power of the providence of the Lord raises it up again, and from one seed many arise and bring forth fruit.\n25. The Phœnix an Emblem of Our Resurrection. Let us consider that wonderful sign of the resurrection which takes place in eastern lands, that is, in Arabia and the countries round about. There is a certain bird which is called a phœnix. This is the only one of its kind, and lives five hundred years. And when the time of its dissolution draws near that it must die, it builds itself a nest of frankincense, and myrrh, and other spices, into which, when the time is fulfilled, it enters and dies. But as the flesh decays a certain kind of worm is produced, which, being nourished by the juices of the dead bird, brings forth feathers. Then, when it has acquired strength, it takes up that nest in which are the bones of its parent, and bearing these it passes from the land of Arabia into Egypt, to the city called Heliopolis. And, in open day, flying in the sight of all men, it places them on the altar of the sun, and having done this, hastens back to its former abode. The priests then inspect the registers of the dates, and find that it has returned exactly as the five hundredth year was completed.\n26. We Shall Rise Again, Then, as the Scripture Also Testifies. Do we then deem it any great and wonderful thing for the Maker of all things to raise up again those that have piously served Him in the assurance of a good faith, when even by a bird He shows us the mightiness of His power to fulfil His promise? For the Scripture says in a certain place, You shall raise me up, and I shall confess unto You; and again, I laid me down, and slept; I awoke, because You are with me; and again, Job says, You shall raise up this flesh of mine, which has suffered all these things. Job 19:25-26\n27. In the Hope of the Resurrection, Let Us Cleave to the Omnipotent and Omniscient God. Having then this hope, let our souls be bound to Him who is faithful in His promises, and just in His judgments. He who has commanded us not to lie, shall much more Himself not lie; for nothing is impossible with God, except to lie. Let His faith therefore be stirred up again within us, and let us consider that all things are near unto Him. By the word of His might He established all things, and by His word He can overthrow them. Who shall say unto Him, What have you done? Or, Who shall resist the power of His strength? When, and as He pleases, He will do all things, and none of the things determined by Him shall pass away. Matthew 24:35 All things are open before Him, and nothing can be hidden from His counsel. The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament shows His handy-work. Day unto day utters speech, and night unto night shows knowledge. And there are no words or speeches of which the voices are not heard. Psalm 19:1-4\n28. God Sees All Things: Therefore Let Us Avoid Transgression. Since then all things are seen and heard by God, let us fear Him, and forsake those wicked works which proceed from evil desires; so that, through His mercy, we may be protected from the judgments to come. For whither can any of us flee from His mighty hand? Or what world will receive any of those who run away from Him? For the Scripture says in a certain place, Whither shall I go, and where shall I be hid from Your presence? If I ascend into heaven, You are there; if I go away even to the uttermost parts of the earth, there is Your right hand; if I make my bed in the abyss, there is Your Spirit. Whither, then, shall anyone go, or where shall he escape from Him who comprehends all things?\n29. Let Us Also Draw Near to God in Purity of Heart. Let us then draw near to Him with holiness of spirit, lifting up pure and undefiled hands unto Him, loving our gracious and merciful Father, who has made us partakers in the blessings of His elect. For thus it is written, When the Most High divided the nations, when He scattered the sons of Adam, He fixed the bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels of God. His people Jacob became the portion of the Lord, and Israel the lot of His inheritance. Deuteronomy 32:8-9 And in another place the Scripture says, Behold, the Lord takes unto Himself a nation out of the midst of the nations, as a man takes the first-fruits of his threshing-floor; and from that nation shall come forth the Most Holy.\n30. Let Us Do Those Things that Please God, and Flee from Those He Hates, that We May Be Blessed. Seeing, therefore, that we are the portion of the Holy One, let us do all those things which pertain to holiness, avoiding all evil-speaking, all abominable and impure embraces, together with all drunkenness, seeking after change, all abominable lusts, detestable adultery, and execrable pride. For God, says the Scripture, resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble. Let us cleave, then, to those to whom grace has been given by God. Let us clothe ourselves with concord and humility, ever exercising self-control, standing far off from all whispering and evil-speaking, being justified by our works, and not our words. For the Scripture says, He that speaks much, shall also hear much in answer. And does he that is ready in speech deem himself righteous? Blessed is he that is born of woman, who lives but a short time: be not given to much speaking. Let our praise be in God, and not of ourselves; for God hates those that commend themselves. Let testimony to our good deeds be borne by others, as it was in the case of our righteous forefathers. Boldness, and arrogance, and audacity belong to those that are accursed of God; but moderation, humility, and meekness to such as are blessed by Him.\n31. Let Us See by What Means We May Obtain the Divine Blessing. Let us cleave then to His blessing, and consider what are the means of possessing it. Let us think over the things which have taken place from the beginning. For what reason was our father Abraham blessed? Was it not because he wrought righteousness and truth through faith? Isaac, James 2:21 with perfect confidence, as if knowing what was to happen, cheerfully yielded himself as a sacrifice. Genesis 22:6-10 Jacob, through reason of his brother, went forth with humility from his own land, and came to Laban and served him; and there was given to him the sceptre of the twelve tribes of Israel.\n32. We are Justified Not by Our Own Works, But by Faith. Whosoever will candidly consider each particular, will recognise the greatness of the gifts which were given by him. For from him have sprung the priests and all the Levites who minister at the altar of God. From him also was descended our Lord Jesus Christ according to the flesh. Romans 9:5 From him arose kings, princes, and rulers of the race of Judah. Nor are his other tribes in small glory, inasmuch as God had promised, Your seed shall be as the stars of heaven. All these, therefore, were highly honoured, and made great, not for their own sake, or for their own works, or for the righteousness which they wrought, but through the operation of His will. And we, too, being called by His will in Christ Jesus, are not justified by ourselves, nor by our own wisdom, or understanding, or godliness, or works which we have wrought in holiness of heart; but by that faith through which, from the beginning, Almighty God has justified all men; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.\n33. But Let Us Not Give Up the Practice of Good Works and Love. God Himself is an Example to Us of Good Works. What shall we do, then, brethren? Shall we become slothful in well-doing, and cease from the practice of love? God forbid that any such course should be followed by us! But rather let us hasten with all energy and readiness of mind to perform every good work. For the Creator and Lord of all Himself rejoices in His works. For by His infinitely great power He established the heavens, and by His incomprehensible wisdom He adorned them. He also divided the earth from the water which surrounds it, and fixed it upon the immovable foundation of His own will. The animals also which are upon it He commanded by His own word into existence. So likewise, when He had formed the sea, and the living creatures which are in it, He enclosed them within their proper bounds by His own power. Above all, with His holy and undefiled hands He formed man, the most excellent of His creatures, and truly great through the understanding given him — the express likeness of His own image. For thus says God: Let us make man in our image, and after our likeness. So God made man; male and female He created them. Genesis 1:26-27 Having thus finished all these things, He approved them, and blessed them, and said, Increase and multiply. Genesis 1:28 We see, then, how all righteous men have been adorned with good works, and how the Lord Himself, adorning Himself with His works, rejoiced. Having therefore such an example, let us without delay accede to His will, and let us work the work of righteousness with our whole strength.\n34. Great is the Reward of Good Works with God. Joined Together in Harmony, Let Us Implore that Reward from Him. The good servant receives the bread of his labour with confidence; the lazy and slothful cannot look his employer in the face. It is requisite, therefore, that we be prompt in the practice of well-doing; for of Him are all things. And thus He forewarns us: Behold, the Lord comes, and His reward is before His face, to render to every man according to his work. He exhorts us, therefore, with our whole heart to attend to this, that we be not lazy or slothful in any good work. Let our boasting and our confidence be in Him. Let us submit ourselves to His will. Let us consider the whole multitude of His angels, how they stand ever ready to minister to His will. For the Scripture says, Ten thousand times ten thousand stood around Him, and thousands of thousands ministered unto Him, Daniel 7:10 and cried, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Sabaoth; the whole creation is full of His glory. Isaiah 6:3 And let us therefore, conscientiously gathering together in harmony, cry to Him earnestly, as with one mouth, that we may be made partakers of His great and glorious promises. For the Scripture says, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which He has prepared for them that wait for Him. 1 Corinthians 2:9\n35. Immense is This Reward. How Shall We Obtain It? How blessed and wonderful, beloved, are the gifts of God! Life in immortality, splendour in righteousness, truth in perfect confidence, faith in assurance, self-control in holiness! And all these fall under the cognizance of our understandings now; what then shall those things be which are prepared for such as wait for Him? The Creator and Father of all worlds, the Most Holy, alone knows their amount and their beauty. Let us therefore earnestly strive to be found in the number of those that wait for Him, in order that we may share in His promised gifts. But how, beloved, shall this be done? If our understanding be fixed by faith towards God; if we earnestly seek the things which are pleasing and acceptable to Him; if we do the things which are in harmony with His blameless will; and if we follow the way of truth, casting away from us all unrighteousness and iniquity, along with all covetousness, strife, evil practices, deceit, whispering, and evil-speaking, all hatred of God, pride and haughtiness, vain glory and ambition. For they that do such things are hateful to God; and not only they that do them, but also those that take pleasure in them that do them. Romans 1:32 For the Scripture says, But to the sinner God said, Wherefore do you declare my statutes, and take my covenant into your mouth, seeing you hate instruction, and castest my words behind you? When you saw a thief, you consented with him, and made your portion with adulterers. Your mouth has abounded with wickedness, and your tongue contrived deceit. You sit, and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother\u0026rsquo;s son. These things you have done, and I kept silence; you thought, wicked one, that I should be like to yourself. But I will reprove you, and set yourself before you. Consider now these things, you that forget God, lest He tear you in pieces, like a lion, and there be none to deliver. The sacrifice of praise will glorify me, and a way is there by which I will show him the salvation of God.\n36. All Blessings are Given to Us Through Christ. This is the way, beloved, in which we find our Saviour, even Jesus Christ, the High Priest of all our offerings, the defender and helper of our infirmity. By Him we look up to the heights of heaven. By Him we behold, as in a glass, His immaculate and most excellent visage. By Him are the eyes of our hearts opened. By Him our foolish and darkened understanding blossoms up anew towards His marvellous light. By Him the Lord has willed that we should taste of immortal knowledge, who, being the brightness of His majesty, is by so much greater than the angels, as He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. Hebrews 1:3-4 For it is thus written, Who makes His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire. But concerning His Son the Lord spoke thus: You are my Son, today have I begotten You. Ask of me, and I will give You the heathen for Your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Your possession. And again He says to Him, Sit at my right hand, until I make Your enemies Your footstool. But who are His enemies? All the wicked, and those who set themselves to oppose the will of God.\n37. Christ is Our Leader, and We His Soldiers. Let us then, men and brethren, with all energy act the part of soldiers, in accordance with His holy commandments. Let us consider those who serve under our generals, with what order, obedience, and submissiveness they perform the things which are commanded them. All are not prefects, nor commanders of a thousand, nor of a hundred, nor of fifty, nor the like, but each one in his own rank performs the things commanded by the king and the generals. The great cannot subsist without the small, nor the small without the great. There is a kind of mixture in all things, and thence arises mutual advantage. Let us take our body for an example. The head is nothing without the feet, and the feet are nothing without the head; yea, the very smallest members of our body are necessary and useful to the whole body. But all work harmoniously together, and are under one common rule for the preservation of the whole body.\n38. Let the Members of the Church Submit Themselves, and No One Exalt Himself Above Another. Let our whole body, then, be preserved in Christ Jesus; and let every one be subject to his neighbour, according to the special gift bestowed upon him. Let the strong not despise the weak, and let the weak show respect unto the strong. Let the rich man provide for the wants of the poor; and let the poor man bless God, because He has given him one by whom his need may be supplied. Let the wise man display his wisdom, not by mere words, but through good deeds. Let the humble not bear testimony to himself, but leave witness to be borne to him by another. Proverbs 27:2 Let him that is pure in the flesh not grow proud of it, and boast, knowing that it was another who bestowed on him the gift of continence. Let us consider, then, brethren, of what matter we were made — who and what manner of beings we came into the world, as it were out of a sepulchre, and from utter darkness. He who made us and fashioned us, having prepared His bountiful gifts for us before we were born, introduced us into His world. Since, therefore, we receive all these things from Him, we ought for everything to give Him thanks; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.\n39. There is No Reason for Self-Conceit. Foolish and inconsiderate men, who have neither wisdom nor instruction, mock and deride us, being eager to exalt themselves in their own conceits. For what can a mortal man do, or what strength is there in one made out of the dust? For it is written, There was no shape before my eyes, only I heard a sound, and a voice saying, What then? Shall a man be pure before the Lord? Or shall such an one be counted blameless in his deeds, seeing He does not confide in His servants, and has charged even His angels with perversity? The heaven is not clean in His sight: how much less they that dwell in houses of clay, of which also we ourselves were made! He smote them as a moth; and from morning even until evening they endure not. Because they could furnish no assistance to themselves, they perished. He breathed upon them, and they died, because they had no wisdom. But call now, if any one will answer you, or if you will look to any of the holy angels; for wrath destroys the foolish man, and envy kills him that is in error. I have seen the foolish taking root, but their habitation was presently consumed. Let their sons be far from safety; let them be despised before the gates of those less than themselves, and there shall be none to deliver. For what was prepared for them, the righteous shall eat; and they shall not be delivered from evil.\n40. Let Us Preserve in the Church the Order Appointed by God. These things therefore being manifest to us, and since we look into the depths of the divine knowledge, it behooves us to do all things in their proper order, which the Lord has commanded us to perform at stated times. He has enjoined offerings to be presented and service to be performed to Him, and that not thoughtlessly or irregularly, but at the appointed times and hours. Where and by whom He desires these things to be done, He Himself has fixed by His own supreme will, in order that all things, being piously done according to His good pleasure, may be acceptable unto Him. Those, therefore, who present their offerings at the appointed times, are accepted and blessed; for inasmuch as they follow the laws of the Lord, they sin not. For his own peculiar services are assigned to the high priest, and their own proper place is prescribed to the priests, and their own special ministrations devolve on the Levites. The layman is bound by the laws that pertain to laymen.\n41. Continuation of the Same Subject. Let every one of you, brethren, give thanks to God in his own order, living in all good conscience, with becoming gravity, and not going beyond the rule of the ministry prescribed to him. Not in every place, brethren, are the daily sacrifices offered, or the peace-offerings, or the sin-offerings and the trespass-offerings, but in Jerusalem only. And even there they are not offered in any place, but only at the altar before the temple, that which is offered being first carefully examined by the high priest and the ministers already mentioned. Those, therefore, who do anything beyond that which is agreeable to His will, are punished with death. You see, brethren, that the greater the knowledge that has been vouchsafed to us, the greater also is the danger to which we are exposed.\n42. The Order of Ministers in the Church. The apostles have preached the gospel to us from the Lord Jesus Christ; Jesus Christ has done so from God. Christ therefore was sent forth by God, and the apostles by Christ. Both these appointments, then, were made in an orderly way, according to the will of God. Having therefore received their orders, and being fully assured by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, and established in the word of God, with full assurance of the Holy Ghost, they went forth proclaiming that the kingdom of God was at hand. And thus preaching through countries and cities, they appointed the first fruits of their labours, having first proved them by the Spirit, to be bishops and deacons of those who should afterwards believe. Nor was this any new thing, since indeed many ages before it was written concerning bishops and deacons. For thus says the Scripture in a certain place, I will appoint their bishops in righteousness, and their deacons in faith.\n43. Moses of Old Stilled the Contention Which Arose Concerning the Priestly Dignity. And what wonder is it if those in Christ who were entrusted with such a duty by God, appointed those ministers before mentioned, when the blessed Moses also, a faithful servant in all his house, noted down in the sacred books all the injunctions which were given him, and when the other prophets also followed him, bearing witness with one consent to the ordinances which he had appointed? For, when rivalry arose concerning the priesthood, and the tribes were contending among themselves as to which of them should be adorned with that glorious title, he commanded the twelve princes of the tribes to bring him their rods, each one being inscribed with the name of the tribe. And he took them and bound them together, and sealed them with the rings of the princes of the tribes, and laid them up in the tabernacle of witness on the table of God. And having shut the doors of the tabernacle, he sealed the keys, as he had done the rods, and said to them, Men and brethren, the tribe whose rod shall blossom has God chosen to fulfil the office of the priesthood, and to minister unto Him. And when the morning had come, he assembled all Israel, six hundred thousand men, and showed the seals to the princes of the tribes, and opened the tabernacle of witness, and brought forth the rods. And the rod of Aaron was found not only to have blossomed, but to bear fruit upon it. What think ye, beloved? Did not Moses know beforehand that this would happen? Undoubtedly he knew; but he acted thus, that there might be no sedition in Israel, and that the name of the true and only God might be glorified; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.\n44. The Ordinances of the Apostles, that There Might Be No Contention Respecting the Priestly Office. Our apostles also knew, through our Lord Jesus Christ, that there would be strife on account of the office of the episcopate. For this reason, therefore, inasmuch as they had obtained a perfect fore-knowledge of this, they appointed those ministers already mentioned, and afterwards gave instructions, that when these should fall asleep, other approved men should succeed them in their ministry. We are of opinion, therefore, that those appointed by them, or afterwards by other eminent men, with the consent of the whole church, and who have blamelessly served the flock of Christ, in a humble, peaceable, and disinterested spirit, and have for a long time possessed the good opinion of all, cannot be justly dismissed from the ministry. For our sin will not be small, if we eject from the episcopate those who have blamelessly and holily fulfilled its duties. Blessed are those presbyters who, having finished their course before now, have obtained a fruitful and perfect departure from this world; for they have no fear lest any one deprive them of the place now appointed them. But we see that you have removed some men of excellent behaviour from the ministry, which they fulfilled blamelessly and with honour.\n45. It is the Part of the Wicked to Vex the Righteous. You are fond of contention, brethren, and full of zeal about things which do not pertain to salvation. Look carefully into the Scriptures, which are the true utterances of the Holy Spirit. Observe that nothing of an unjust or counterfeit character is written in them. There you will not find that the righteous were cast off by men who themselves were holy. The righteous were indeed persecuted, but only by the wicked. They were cast into prison, but only by the unholy; they were stoned, but only by transgressors; they were slain, but only by the accursed, and such as had conceived an unrighteous envy against them. Exposed to such sufferings, they endured them gloriously. For what shall we say, brethren? Was Daniel Daniel 6:16 cast into the den of lions by such as feared God? Were Ananias, and Azarias, and Michael shut up in a furnace Daniel 3:20 of fire by those who observed the great and glorious worship of the Most High? Far from us be such a thought! Who, then, were they that did such things? The hateful, and those full of all wickedness, were roused to such a pitch of fury, that they inflicted torture on those who served God with a holy and blameless purpose of heart, not knowing that the Most High is the Defender and Protector of all such as with a pure conscience venerate His all-excellent name; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. But they who with confidence endured these things are now heirs of glory and honour, and have been exalted and made illustrious by God in their memorial for ever and ever. Amen.\n46. Let Us Cleave to the Righteous: Your Strife is Pernicious. Such examples, therefore, brethren, it is right that we should follow; since it is written, Cleave to the holy, for those that cleave to them shall themselves be made holy. And again, in another place, the Scripture says, With a harmless man you shall prove yourself harmless, and with an elect man you shall be elect, and with a perverse man you shall show yourself perverse. Let us cleave, therefore, to the innocent and righteous, since these are the elect of God. Why are there strifes, and tumults, and divisions, and schisms, and wars among you? Have we not all one God and one Christ? Is there not one Spirit of grace poured out upon us? And have we not one calling in Christ? Ephesians 4:4-6 Why do we divide and tear in pieces the members of Christ, and raise up strife against our own body, and have reached such a height of madness as to forget that we are members one of another? Romans 12:5 Remember the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, how He said, Woe to that man by whom offenses come! It were better for him that he had never been born, than that he should cast a stumbling-block before one of my elect. Yea, it were better for him that a millstone should be hung about his neck, and he should be sunk in the depths of the sea, than that he should cast a stumbling-block before one of my little ones. Your schism has subverted the faith of many, has discouraged many, has given rise to doubt in many, and has caused grief to us all. And still your sedition continues.\n47. Your Recent Discord is Worse Than the Former Which Took Place in the Times of Paul. Take up the epistle of the blessed Apostle Paul. What did he write to you at the time when the gospel first began to be preached? Truly, under the inspiration of the Spirit, he wrote to you concerning himself, and Cephas, and Apollos, because even then parties had been formed among you. But that inclination for one above another entailed less guilt upon you, inasmuch as your partialities were then shown towards apostles, already of high reputation, and towards a man whom they had approved. But now reflect who those are that have perverted you, and lessened the renown of your far-famed brotherly love. It is disgraceful, beloved, yea, highly disgraceful, and unworthy of your Christian profession, that such a thing should be heard of as that the most steadfast and ancient church of the Corinthians should, on account of one or two persons, engage in sedition against its presbyters. And this rumour has reached not only us, but those also who are unconnected with us; so that, through your infatuation, the name of the Lord is blasphemed, while danger is also brought upon yourselves.\n48. Let Us Return to the Practice of Brotherly Love. Let us therefore, with all haste, put an end to this state of things; and let us fall down before the Lord, and beseech Him with tears, that He would mercifully be reconciled to us, and restore us to our former seemly and holy practice of brotherly love. For such conduct is the gate of righteousness, which is set open for the attainment of life, as it is written, Open to me the gates of righteousness; I will go in by them, and will praise the Lord: this is the gate of the Lord: the righteous shall enter in by it. Although, therefore, many gates have been set open, yet this gate of righteousness is that gate in Christ by which blessed are all they that have entered in and have directed their way in holiness and righteousness, doing all things without disorder. Let a man be faithful: let him be powerful in the utterance of knowledge; let him be wise in judging of words; let him be pure in all his deeds; yet the more he seems to be superior to others in these respects, the more humble-minded ought he to be, and to seek the common good of all, and not merely his own advantage.\n49. The Praise of Love. Let him who has love in Christ keep the commandments of Christ. Who can describe the blessed bond of the love of God? What man is able to tell the excellence of its beauty, as it ought to be told? The height to which love exalts is unspeakable. Love unites us to God. Love covers a multitude of sins. Love bears all things, is long-suffering in all things. There is nothing base, nothing arrogant in love. Love admits of no schisms: love gives rise to no seditions: love does all things in harmony. By love have all the elect of God been made perfect; without love nothing is well-pleasing to God. In love has the Lord taken us to Himself. On account of the love He bore us, Jesus Christ our Lord gave His blood for us by the will of God; His flesh for our flesh, and His soul for our souls.\n50. Let Us Pray to Be Thought Worthy of Love. You see, beloved, how great and wonderful a thing is love, and that there is no declaring its perfection. Who is fit to be found in it, except such as God has vouchsafed to render so? Let us pray, therefore, and implore of His mercy, that we may live blameless in love, free from all human partialities for one above another. All the generations from Adam even unto this day have passed away; but those who, through the grace of God, have been made perfect in love, now possess a place among the godly, and shall be made manifest at the revelation of the kingdom of Christ. For it is written, Enter into your secret chambers for a little time, until my wrath and fury pass away; and I will remember a propitious day, and will raise you up out of your graves. Isaiah 26:20 Blessed are we, beloved, if we keep the commandments of God in the harmony of love; that so through love our sins may be forgiven us. For it is written, Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not impute to him, and in whose mouth there is no guile. This blessedness comes upon those who have been chosen by God through Jesus Christ our Lord; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.\n51. Let the Partakers in Strife Acknowledge Their Sins. Let us therefore implore forgiveness for all those transgressions which through any suggestion of the adversary we have committed. And these who have been the leaders of sedition and disagreement ought to have respect to the common hope. For such as live in fear and love would rather that they themselves than their neighbours should be involved in suffering. And they prefer to bear blame themselves, rather than that the concord which has been well and piously handed down to us should suffer. For it is better that a man should acknowledge his transgressions than that he should harden his heart, as the hearts of those were hardened who stirred up sedition against Moses the servant of God, and whose condemnation was made manifest unto all. For they went down alive into Hades, and death swallowed them up. Pharaoh with his army and all the princes of Egypt, and the chariots with their riders, were sunk in the depths of the Red Sea, and perished, Exodus xiv for no other reason than that their foolish hearts were hardened, after so many signs and wonders had been wrought in the land of Egypt by Moses the servant of God.\n52. Such a Confession is Pleasing to God. The Lord, brethren, stands in need of nothing; and He desires nothing of any one except that confession be made to Him. For, says the elect David, I will confess unto the Lord; and that will please Him more than a young bullock that has horns and hoofs. Let the poor see it, and be glad. And again he says, Offer unto God the sacrifice of praise, and pay your vows unto the Most High. And call upon me in the day of your trouble: I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me. For the sacrifice of God is a broken spirit.\n53. The Love of Moses Towards His People. You understand, beloved, you understand well the sacred Scriptures, and you have looked very earnestly into the oracles of God. Call then these things to your remembrance. When Moses went up into the mount, and abode there, with fasting and humiliation, forty days and forty nights, the Lord said to him, Moses, Moses, get you down quickly from hence; for your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt have committed iniquity. They have speedily departed from the way in which I commanded them to walk, and have made to themselves molten images. And the Lord said to him, I have spoken to you once and again, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people: let me destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make you a great and wonderful nation, and one much more numerous than this. But Moses said, Far be it from You, Lord: pardon the sin of this people; else blot me also out of the book of the living. Exodus 32:32 O marvellous love! O insuperable perfection! The servant speaks freely to his Lord, and asks forgiveness for the people, or begs that he himself might perish along with them.\n54. He Who is Full of Love Will Incur Every Loss, that Peace May Be Restored to the Church. Who then among you is noble-minded? Who compassionate? Who full of love? Let him declare, If on my account sedition and disagreement and schisms have arisen, I will depart, I will go away wherever ye desire, and I will do whatever the majority commands; only let the flock of Christ live on terms of peace with the presbyters set over it. He that acts thus shall procure to himself great glory in the Lord; and every place will welcome him. For the earth is the Lord\u0026rsquo;s, and the fullness thereof. These things they who live a godly life that is never to be repented of, both have done and always will do.\n55. Examples of Such Love. To bring forward some examples from among the heathen: Many kings and princes, in times of pestilence, when they had been instructed by an oracle, have given themselves up to death, in order that by their own blood they might deliver their fellow citizens from destruction. Many have gone forth from their own cities, that so sedition might be brought to an end within them. We know many among ourselves who have given themselves up to bonds, in order that they might ransom others. Many, too, have surrendered themselves to slavery, that with the price which they received for themselves, they might provide food for others. Many women also, being strengthened by the grace of God, have performed numerous manly exploits. The blessed Judith, when her city was besieged, asked of the elders permission to go forth into the camp of the strangers; and, exposing herself to danger, she went out for the love which she bare to her country and people then besieged; and the Lord delivered Holofernes into the hands of a woman. Judith 8:30 Esther also, being perfect in faith, exposed herself to no less danger, in order to deliver the twelve tribes of Israel from impending destruction. For with fasting and humiliation she entreated the everlasting God, who sees all things; and He, perceiving the humility of her spirit, delivered the people for whose sake she had encountered peril.\n56. Let Us Admonish and Correct One Another. Let us then also pray for those who have fallen into any sin, that meekness and humility may be given to them, so that they may submit, not unto us, but to the will of God. For in this way they shall secure a fruitful and perfect remembrance from us, with sympathy for them, both in our prayers to God, and our mention of them to the saints. Let us receive correction, beloved, on account of which no one should feel displeased. Those exhortations by which we admonish one another are both good in themselves, and highly profitable, for they tend to unite us to the will of God. For thus says the holy Word: The Lord has severely chastened me, yet has not given me over to death. For whom the Lord loves He chastens, and scourges every son whom He receives. The righteous, says it, shall chasten me in mercy, and reprove me; but let not the oil of sinners make fat my head. And again he says, Blessed is the man whom the Lord reproves, and reject not the warning of the Almighty. For He causes sorrow, and again restores to gladness; He wounds, and His hands make whole. He shall deliver you in six troubles, yea, in the seventh no evil shall touch you. In famine He shall rescue you from death, and in war He shall free you from the power of the sword. From the scourge of the tongue will He hide you, and you shall not fear when evil comes. You shall laugh at the unrighteous and the wicked, and shall not be afraid of the beasts of the field. For the wild beasts shall be at peace with you: then shall you know that your house shall be in peace, and the habitation of your tabernacle shall not fail. You shall know also that your seed shall be great, and your children like the grass of the field. And you shall come to the grave like ripened grain which is reaped in its season, or like a heap of the threshing-floor which is gathered together at the proper time. Job 5:17-26 You see, beloved, that protection is afforded to those that are chastened of the Lord; for since God is good, He corrects us, that we may be admonished by His holy chastisement.\n57. Let the Authors of Sedition Submit Themselves. You therefore, who laid the foundation of this sedition, submit yourselves to the presbyters, and receive correction so as to repent, bending the knees of your hearts. Learn to be subject, laying aside the proud and arrogant self-confidence of your tongue. For it is better for you that you should occupy a humble but honourable place in the flock of Christ, than that, being highly exalted, you should be cast out from the hope of His people. For thus speaks all-virtuous Wisdom: Behold, I will bring forth to you the words of my Spirit, and I will teach you my speech. Since I called, and you did not hear; I held forth my words, and you regarded not, but set at naught my counsels, and yielded not at my reproofs; therefore I too will laugh at your destruction; yea, I will rejoice when ruin comes upon you, and when sudden confusion overtakes you, when overturning presents itself like a tempest, or when tribulation and oppression fall upon you. For it shall come to pass, that when you call upon me, I will not hear you; the wicked shall seek me, and they shall not find me. For they hated wisdom, and did not choose the fear of the Lord; nor would they listen to my counsels, but despised my reproofs. Wherefore they shall eat the fruits of their own way, and they shall be filled with their own ungodliness. Proverbs 1:22-33 \u0026hellip;For, in punishment for the wrongs which they practised upon babes, shall they be slain, and inquiry will be death to the ungodly; but he that hears me shall rest in hope and be undisturbed by the fear of any evil.\n58. Submission the Precursor of Salvation. Let us, therefore, flee from the warning threats pronounced by Wisdom on the disobedient, and yield submission to His all-holy and glorious name, that we may stay our trust upon the most hallowed name of His majesty. Receive our counsel, and you shall be without repentance. For, as God lives, and as the Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost live — both the faith and hope of the elect, he who in lowliness of mind, with instant gentleness, and without repentance has observed the ordinances and appointments given by God— the same shall obtain a place and name in the number of those who are being saved through Jesus Christ, through whom is glory to Him for ever and ever. Amen.\n59. Warning Against Disobedience. Prayer. If, however, any shall disobey the words spoken by Him through us, let them know that they will involve themselves in transgression and serious danger; but we shall be innocent of this sin, and, instant in prayer and supplication, shall desire that the Creator of all preserve unbroken the computed number of His elect in the whole world through His beloved Son Jesus Christ, through whom He called us from darkness to light, from ignorance to knowledge of the glory of His name, our hope resting on Your name which is primal cause of every creature — having opened the eyes of our heart to the knowledge of You, who alone rests highest among the highest, holy among the holy, Isaiah 57:15 who layest low the insolence of the haughty, Isaiah 13:11 who destroyest the calculations of the heathen, who settest the low on high and bringest low the exalted; who makest rich and makest poor, 1 Samuel 2:7 who killest and makest to live, Deuteronomy 32:39 only Benefactor of spirits and God of all flesh, who beholdest the depths, the eye-witness of human works, the help of those in danger, the Saviour of those in despair, the Creator and Guardian of every spirit, who multipliest nations upon earth, and from all made choice of those who love You through Jesus Christ, Your beloved Son, through whom You instructed, sanctify, honour us. We would have You, Lord, to prove our help and succour. Those of us in affliction save, on the lowly take pity; the fallen raise; upon those in need arise; the sick heal; the wandering ones of Your people turn; fill the hungry; redeem those of us in bonds; raise up those that are weak; comfort the faint-hearted; let all the nations know that You are God alone and Jesus Christ Your Son, and we are Your people and the sheep of Your pasture.\n60. Prayer Continued. You made to appear the enduring fabric of the world by the works of Your hand; You, Lord, created the earth on which we dwell — You, who is faithful in all generations, just in judgments, wonderful in strength and majesty, with wisdom creating and with understanding fixing the things which were made, who art good among them that are being saved and faithful among them whose trust is in You; O merciful and Compassionate One, forgive us our iniquities and offenses and transgressions and trespasses. Reckon not every sin of Your servants and handmaids, but You will purify us with the purification of Your truth; and direct our steps that we may walk in holiness of heart and do what is good and well-pleasing in Your sight and in the sight of our rulers. Yea, Lord, make Your face to shine upon us for good in peace, that we may be shielded by Your mighty hand and delivered from every sin by Your uplifted arm, and deliver us from those who hate us wrongfully. Give concord and peace to us and all who dwell upon the earth, even as You gave to our fathers, when they called upon You in faith and truth, submissive as we are to Your almighty and all-excellent Name.\n61. Prayer Continued — For Rulers and Governors. To our rulers and governors on the earth — to them You, Lord, gave the power of the kingdom by Your glorious and ineffable might, to the end that we may know the glory and honour given to them by You and be subject to them, in nought resisting Your will; to them, Lord, give health, peace, concord, stability, that they may exercise the authority given to them without offense. For You, O heavenly Lord and King eternal, givest to the sons of men glory and honour and power over the things that are on the earth; do Thou, Lord, direct their counsel according to that which is good and well-pleasing in Your sight, that, devoutly in peace and meekness exercising the power given them by You, they may find You propitious. O Thou, who only has power to do these things and more abundant good with us, we praise You through the High Priest and Guardian of our souls Jesus Christ, through whom be glory and majesty to You both now and from generation to generation and for evermore. Amen.\n62. Summary and Conclusory — Concerning Godliness. Concerning the things pertaining to our religious observance which are most profitable for a life of goodness to those who would pursue a godly and righteous course, we have written to you, men and brethren, at sufficient length. For concerning faith and repentance and true love and continence and soberness and patience, we have touched upon every passage, putting you in mind that you ought in righteousness and truth and long-suffering to be well-pleasing to Almighty God with holiness, being of one mind — not remembering evil— in love and peace with instant gentleness, even as also our fathers forementioned found favour by the humility of their thoughts towards the Father and God and Creator and all mankind. And of these things we put you in mind with the greater pleasure, since we were well assured that we were writing to men who were faithful and of highest repute and had peered into the oracles of the instruction of God.\n63. Hortatory, Letter Sent by Special Messengers. Right is it, therefore, to approach examples so good and so many, and submit the neck and fulfil the part of obedience, in order that, undisturbed by vain sedition, we may attain unto the goal set before us in truth wholly free from blame. Joy and gladness will you afford us, if you become obedient to the words written by us and through the Holy Spirit root out the lawless wrath of your jealousy according to the intercession which we have made for peace and unity in this letter. We have sent men faithful and discreet, whose conversation from youth to old age has been blameless among us — the same shall be witnesses between you and us. This we have done, that you may know that our whole concern has been and is that you may be speedily at peace.\n64. Blessings Sought for All that Call Upon God. May God, who sees all things, and who is the Ruler of all spirits and the Lord of all flesh — who chose our Lord Jesus Christ and us through Him to be a peculiar Titus 2:14 people — grant to every soul that calls upon His glorious and holy name, faith, fear, peace, patience, long-suffering, self-control, purity, and sobriety, to the well-pleasing of His name, through our High Priest and Protector, Jesus Christ, by whom be to Him glory, and majesty, and power, and honour, both now and for evermore. Amen.\n65. Exhortation \u0026amp; The Benediction. Send back speedily to us in peace and with joy these our messengers to you: Claudius Ephebus and Valerius Bito, with Fortunatus; that they may the sooner announce to us the peace and harmony we so earnestly desire and long for among you, and that we may the more quickly rejoice over the good order re-established among you. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, and with all everywhere that are the called of God through Him, by whom be to Him glory, honour, power, majesty, and eternal dominion, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen.\nSources   Translated by John Keith. From Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. 9. Edited by Allan Menzies. (Buffalo, NY: Christian Literature Publishing Co., 1896.)
