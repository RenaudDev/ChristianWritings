    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light.</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>Surely he turns his hand against me again and again all day long.</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>He has made my flesh and my skin old. He has broken my bones.</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>He has built against me, and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>He has made me dwell in dark places, as those who have been long dead.</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>He has walled me about, so that I can&rsquo;t go out. He has made my chain heavy.</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>Yes, when I cry, and call for help, he shuts out my prayer.</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>He has walled up my ways with cut stone. He has made my paths crooked.</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>He is to me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>He has turned away my ways, and pulled me in pieces. He has made me desolate.</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys.</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>I have become a derision to all my people, and their song all day long.</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>He has filled me with bitterness. He has stuffed me with wormwood.</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>He has also broken my teeth with gravel. He has covered me with ashes.</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>You have removed my soul far away from peace. I forgot prosperity.</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>I said, &ldquo;My strength has perished, along with my expectation from Yahweh.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>Remember my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the bitterness.</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>My soul still remembers them, and is bowed down within me.</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>This I recall to my mind; therefore I have hope.</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>It is because of Yahweh&rsquo;s loving kindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassion doesn&rsquo;t fail.</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>They are new every morning. Great is your faithfulness.</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>&ldquo;Yahweh is my portion,&rdquo; says my soul. &ldquo;Therefore I will hope in him.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>Yahweh is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him.</p>
<h6 id="v26">v26</h6>
<p>It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh.</p>
<h6 id="v27">v27</h6>
<p>It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</p>
<h6 id="v28">v28</h6>
<p>Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he has laid it on him.</p>
<h6 id="v29">v29</h6>
<p>Let him put his mouth in the dust, if it is so that there may be hope.</p>
<h6 id="v30">v30</h6>
<p>Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him. Let him be filled full of reproach.</p>
<h6 id="v31">v31</h6>
<p>For the Lord will not cast off forever.</p>
<h6 id="v32">v32</h6>
<p>For though he causes grief, yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.</p>
<h6 id="v33">v33</h6>
<p>For he does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</p>
<h6 id="v34">v34</h6>
<p>To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,</p>
<h6 id="v35">v35</h6>
<p>to turn away the right of a man before the face of the Most High,</p>
<h6 id="v36">v36</h6>
<p>to subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn&rsquo;t approve.</p>
<h6 id="v37">v37</h6>
<p>Who is he who says, and it comes to pass, when the Lord doesn&rsquo;t command it?</p>
<h6 id="v38">v38</h6>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High?</p>
<h6 id="v39">v39</h6>
<p>Why does a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?</p>
<h6 id="v40">v40</h6>
<p>Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Yahweh.</p>
<h6 id="v41">v41</h6>
<p>Let&rsquo;s lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens.</p>
<h6 id="v42">v42</h6>
<p>&ldquo;We have transgressed and have rebelled. You have not pardoned.</p>
<h6 id="v43">v43</h6>
<p>&ldquo;You have covered us with anger and pursued us. You have killed. You have not pitied.</p>
<h6 id="v44">v44</h6>
<p>You have covered yourself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.</p>
<h6 id="v45">v45</h6>
<p>You have made us an off-scouring and refuse in the middle of the peoples.</p>
<h6 id="v46">v46</h6>
<p>&ldquo;All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.</p>
<h6 id="v47">v47</h6>
<p>Terror and the pit have come on us, devastation and destruction.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v48">v48</h6>
<p>My eye runs down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>
<h6 id="v49">v49</h6>
<p>My eye pours down and doesn&rsquo;t cease, without any intermission,</p>
<h6 id="v50">v50</h6>
<p>until Yahweh looks down, and sees from heaven.</p>
<h6 id="v51">v51</h6>
<p>My eye affects my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.</p>
<h6 id="v52">v52</h6>
<p>They have chased me relentlessly like a bird, those who are my enemies without cause.</p>
<h6 id="v53">v53</h6>
<p>They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone on me.</p>
<h6 id="v54">v54</h6>
<p>Waters flowed over my head. I said, &ldquo;I am cut off.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v55">v55</h6>
<p>I called on your name, Yahweh, out of the lowest dungeon.</p>
<h6 id="v56">v56</h6>
<p>You heard my voice: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hide your ear from my sighing, and my cry.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v57">v57</h6>
<p>You came near in the day that I called on you. You said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v58">v58</h6>
<p>Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul. You have redeemed my life.</p>
<h6 id="v59">v59</h6>
<p>Yahweh, you have seen my wrong. Judge my cause.</p>
<h6 id="v60">v60</h6>
<p>You have seen all their vengeance and all their plans against me.</p>
<h6 id="v61">v61</h6>
<p>You have heard their reproach, Yahweh, and all their plans against me,</p>
<h6 id="v62">v62</h6>
<p>the lips of those that rose up against me, and their plots against me all day long.</p>
<h6 id="v63">v63</h6>
<p>You see their sitting down and their rising up. I am their song.</p>
<h6 id="v64">v64</h6>
<p>You will pay them back, Yahweh, according to the work of their hands.</p>
<h6 id="v65">v65</h6>
<p>You will give them hardness of heart, your curse to them.</p>
<h6 id="v66">v66</h6>
<p>You will pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh.</p>
