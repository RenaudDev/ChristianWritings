tree.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>You shall break down their altars, dash their pillars in pieces, and burn their Asherah poles with fire. You shall cut down the engraved images of their gods. You shall destroy their name out of that place.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>You shall not do so to Yahweh your God.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>But to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, you shall seek his habitation, and you shall come there.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>You shall bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the wave offering of your hand, your vows, your free will offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock there.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>There you shall eat before Yahweh your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, in which Yahweh your God has blessed you.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>You shall not do all the things that we do here today, every man whatever is right in his own eyes;</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>for you haven&rsquo;t yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which Yahweh your God gives you.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>But when you go over the Jordan and dwell in the land which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit, and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you, so that you dwell in safety,</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>then it shall happen that to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, there you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the wave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to Yahweh.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God&ndash;you, and your sons, your daughters, your male servants, your female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>Be careful that you don&rsquo;t offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see;</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>but in the place which Yahweh chooses in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Yet you may kill and eat meat within all your gates, after all the desire of your soul, according to Yahweh your God&rsquo;s blessing which he has given you.
