    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>Now these are the nations which Yahweh left, to test Israel by them, even as many as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at least those who knew nothing of it before:</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>the five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>They were left to test Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to Yahweh&rsquo;s commandments, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>The children of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>They took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>The children of Israel did that which was evil in Yahweh&rsquo;s sight, and forgot Yahweh their God, and served the Baals and the Asheroth.</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>Therefore Yahweh&rsquo;s anger burned against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years.</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb&rsquo;s younger brother.</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>Yahweh&rsquo;s Spirit came on him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Yahweh delivered Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand. His hand prevailed against Cushan Rishathaim.</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>The land had rest forty years, then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>The children of Israel again did that which was evil in Yahweh&rsquo;s sight, and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in Yahweh&rsquo;s sight.</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>He gathered the children of Ammon and Amalek to himself; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>But when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior for them: Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. The children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he wore it under his clothing on his right thigh.</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>When Ehud had finished offering the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute.</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>But he himself turned back from the stone idols that were by Gilgal, and said, &ldquo;I have a secret message for you, O king.&rdquo; The king said, &ldquo;Keep silence!&rdquo; All who stood by him left him.</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud said, &ldquo;I have a message from God to you.&rdquo; He arose out of his seat.</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>Ehud put out his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body.</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>The handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn&rsquo;t draw the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>Then Ehud went out onto the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on him, and locked them.</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>After he had gone, his servants came and saw that the doors of the upper room were locked. They said, &ldquo;Surely he is covering his feet in the upper room.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he didn&rsquo;t open the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key and opened them, and behold, their lord had fallen down dead on the floor.</p>
<h6 id="v26">v26</h6>
<p>Ehud escaped while they waited, passed beyond the stone idols, and escaped to Seirah.</p>
<h6 id="v27">v27</h6>
<p>When he had come, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he led them.</p>
<h6 id="v28">v28</h6>
<p>He said to them, &ldquo;Follow me; for Yahweh has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.&rdquo; They followed him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and didn&rsquo;t allow any man to pass over.</p>
<h6 id="v29">v29</h6>
<p>They struck at that time about ten thousand men of Moab, every strong man and every man of valor. No man escaped.</p>
<h6 id="v30">v30</h6>
<p>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. Then the land had rest eighty years.</p>
<h6 id="v31">v31</h6>
<p>After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad. He also saved Israel.</p>
