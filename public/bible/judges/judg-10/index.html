He judged Israel twenty-two years.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts. They had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth Jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>The children of Israel again did that which was evil in Yahweh&rsquo;s sight, and served the Baals, the Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines. They abandoned Yahweh, and didn&rsquo;t serve him.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>Yahweh&rsquo;s anger burned against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the children of Ammon.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>They troubled and oppressed the children of Israel that year.
