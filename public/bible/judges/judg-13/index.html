    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>The children of Israel again did that which was evil in Yahweh&rsquo;s sight; and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and childless.</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>Yahweh&rsquo;s angel appeared to the woman, and said to her, &ldquo;See now, you are barren and childless; but you shall conceive and bear a son.</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>Now therefore please beware and drink no wine nor strong drink, and don&rsquo;t eat any unclean thing;</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>for, behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son. No razor shall come on his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb. He shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, &ldquo;A man of God came to me, and his face was like the face of the angel of God, very awesome. I didn&rsquo;t ask him where he was from, neither did he tell me his name;</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>but he said to me, &lsquo;Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink. Don&rsquo;t eat any unclean thing, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>Then Manoah entreated Yahweh, and said, &ldquo;Oh, Lord, please let the man of God whom you sent come again to us, and teach us what we should do to the child who shall be born.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field; but Manoah, her husband, wasn&rsquo;t with her.</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>The woman hurried and ran, and told her husband, saying to him, &ldquo;Behold, the man who came to me that day has appeared to me,&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>Manoah arose and followed his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, &ldquo;Are you the man who spoke to my wife?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>Manoah said, &ldquo;Now let your words happen. What shall the child&rsquo;s way of life and mission be?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>Yahweh&rsquo;s angel said to Manoah, &ldquo;Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing. Let her observe all that I commanded her.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>Manoah said to Yahweh&rsquo;s angel, &ldquo;Please stay with us, that we may make a young goat ready for you.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>Yahweh&rsquo;s angel said to Manoah, &ldquo;Though you detain me, I won&rsquo;t eat your bread. If you will prepare a burnt offering, you must offer it to Yahweh.&rdquo; For Manoah didn&rsquo;t know that he was Yahweh&rsquo;s angel.</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>Manoah said to Yahweh&rsquo;s angel, &ldquo;What is your name, that when your words happen, we may honor you?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>Yahweh&rsquo;s angel said to him, &ldquo;Why do you ask about my name, since it is incomprehensible?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>So Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering, and offered it on the rock to Yahweh. Then the angel did an amazing thing as Manoah and his wife watched.</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>For when the flame went up toward the sky from off the altar, Yahweh&rsquo;s angel ascended in the flame of the altar. Manoah and his wife watched; and they fell on their faces to the ground.</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>But Yahweh&rsquo;s angel didn&rsquo;t appear to Manoah or to his wife any more. Then Manoah knew that he was Yahweh&rsquo;s angel.</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>Manoah said to his wife, &ldquo;We shall surely die, because we have seen God.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>But his wife said to him, &ldquo;If Yahweh were pleased to kill us, he wouldn&rsquo;t have received a burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand, and he wouldn&rsquo;t have shown us all these things, nor would he have told us such things as these at this time.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>The woman bore a son and named him Samson. The child grew, and Yahweh blessed him.</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>Yahweh&rsquo;s Spirit began to move him in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.</p>
