As I gave you the green herb, I have given everything to you.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>But flesh with its life, that is, its blood, you shall not eat.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>I will surely require accounting for your life&rsquo;s blood. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man&rsquo;s brother, I will require the life of man.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>Whoever sheds man&rsquo;s blood, his blood will be shed by man, for God made man in his own image.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>Be fruitful and multiply.
