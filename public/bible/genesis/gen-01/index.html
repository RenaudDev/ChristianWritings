Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v29>v29</h6><p>God said, &ldquo;Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed.
