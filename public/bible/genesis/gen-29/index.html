For out of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the well&rsquo;s mouth was large.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>There all the flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well&rsquo;s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone back on the well&rsquo;s mouth in its place.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Jacob said to them, &ldquo;My relatives, where are you from?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;We are from Haran.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>He said to them, &ldquo;Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;We know him.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>He said to them, &ldquo;Is it well with him?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;It is well. See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>He said, &ldquo;Behold, it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the livestock together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>They said, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well&rsquo;s mouth. Then we will water the sheep.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father&rsquo;s sheep, for she kept them.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother&rsquo;s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother&rsquo;s brother, Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well&rsquo;s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother&rsquo;s brother.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>Jacob told Rachel that he was her father&rsquo;s relative, and that he was Rebekah&rsquo;s son. She ran and told her father.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>When Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister&rsquo;s son, he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Laban said to him, &ldquo;Surely you are my bone and my flesh.&rdquo; Jacob stayed with him for a month.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Laban said to Jacob, &ldquo;Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>Leah&rsquo;s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive.</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>Jacob loved Rachel. He said, &ldquo;I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>Laban said, &ldquo;It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>Jacob said to Laban, &ldquo;Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>In the evening, he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to Jacob. He went in to her.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>Laban gave Zilpah his servant to his daughter Leah for a servant.</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>In the morning, behold, it was Leah! He said to Laban, &ldquo;What is this you have done to me? Didn&rsquo;t I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>Laban said, &ldquo;It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me for seven more years.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v28>v28</h6><p>Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife.</p><h6 id=v29>v29</h6><p>Laban gave Bilhah, his servant, to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.</p><h6 id=v30>v30</h6><p>He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him seven more years.</p><h6 id=v31>v31</h6><p>Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.</p><h6 id=v32>v32</h6><p>Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said, &ldquo;Because Yahweh has looked at my affliction; for now my husband will love me.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v33>v33</h6><p>She conceived again, and bore a son, and said, &ldquo;Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this son also.&rdquo; She named him Simeon.</p><h6 id=v34>v34</h6><p>She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, &ldquo;Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons.&rdquo; Therefore his name was called Levi.</p><h6 id=v35>v35</h6><p>She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, &ldquo;This time I will praise Yahweh.&rdquo; Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/genesis/gen-28/>Genesis 28</a>
