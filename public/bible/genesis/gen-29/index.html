    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east.</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>He looked, and saw a well in the field, and saw three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the well&rsquo;s mouth was large.</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>There all the flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well&rsquo;s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone back on the well&rsquo;s mouth in its place.</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>Jacob said to them, &ldquo;My relatives, where are you from?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;We are from Haran.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>He said to them, &ldquo;Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;We know him.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>He said to them, &ldquo;Is it well with him?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;It is well. See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>He said, &ldquo;Behold, it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the livestock together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>They said, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well&rsquo;s mouth. Then we will water the sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father&rsquo;s sheep, for she kept them.</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother&rsquo;s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother&rsquo;s brother, Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well&rsquo;s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother&rsquo;s brother.</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>Jacob told Rachel that he was her father&rsquo;s relative, and that he was Rebekah&rsquo;s son. She ran and told her father.</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>When Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister&rsquo;s son, he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things.</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>Laban said to him, &ldquo;Surely you are my bone and my flesh.&rdquo; Jacob stayed with him for a month.</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>Laban said to Jacob, &ldquo;Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>Leah&rsquo;s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive.</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>Jacob loved Rachel. He said, &ldquo;I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>Laban said, &ldquo;It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>Jacob said to Laban, &ldquo;Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>In the evening, he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to Jacob. He went in to her.</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>Laban gave Zilpah his servant to his daughter Leah for a servant.</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>In the morning, behold, it was Leah! He said to Laban, &ldquo;What is this you have done to me? Didn&rsquo;t I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v26">v26</h6>
<p>Laban said, &ldquo;It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.</p>
<h6 id="v27">v27</h6>
<p>Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me for seven more years.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v28">v28</h6>
<p>Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife.</p>
<h6 id="v29">v29</h6>
<p>Laban gave Bilhah, his servant, to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.</p>
<h6 id="v30">v30</h6>
<p>He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him seven more years.</p>
<h6 id="v31">v31</h6>
<p>Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.</p>
<h6 id="v32">v32</h6>
<p>Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said, &ldquo;Because Yahweh has looked at my affliction; for now my husband will love me.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v33">v33</h6>
<p>She conceived again, and bore a son, and said, &ldquo;Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this son also.&rdquo; She named him Simeon.</p>
<h6 id="v34">v34</h6>
<p>She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, &ldquo;Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons.&rdquo; Therefore his name was called Levi.</p>
<h6 id="v35">v35</h6>
<p>She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, &ldquo;This time I will praise Yahweh.&rdquo; Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.</p>
