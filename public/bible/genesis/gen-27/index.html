were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, &ldquo;My son?&rdquo; He said to him, &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>He said, &ldquo;See now, I am old. I don&rsquo;t know the day of my death.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and get me venison.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, and that my soul may bless you before I die.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, &ldquo;Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>&lsquo;Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before Yahweh before my death.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Go now to the flock and get me two good young goats from there. I will make them savory food for your father, such as he loves.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>You shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, &ldquo;Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>What if my father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>His mother said to him, &ldquo;Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get them for me.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savory food, such as his father loved.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>She put the skins of the young goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>She gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>He came to his father, and said, &ldquo;My father?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Here I am. Who are you, my son?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>Jacob said to his father, &ldquo;I am Esau your firstborn. I have done what you asked me to do. Please arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>Isaac said to his son, &ldquo;How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Because Yahweh your God gave me success.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>Isaac said to Jacob, &ldquo;Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>Jacob went near to Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, &ldquo;The voice is Jacob&rsquo;s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>He didn&rsquo;t recognize him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother Esau&rsquo;s hands. So he blessed him.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>He said, &ldquo;Are you really my son Esau?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>He said, &ldquo;Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son&rsquo;s venison, that my soul may bless you.&rdquo; He brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought him wine, and he drank.</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>His father Isaac said to him, &ldquo;Come near now, and kiss me, my son.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>He came near, and kissed him. He smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him, and said, &ldquo;Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed.</p><h6 id=v28>v28</h6><p>God give you of the dew of the sky, of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and new wine.</p><h6 id=v29>v29</h6><p>Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers. Let your mother&rsquo;s sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you. Blessed be everyone who blesses you.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v30>v30</h6><p>As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.</p><h6 id=v31>v31</h6><p>He also made savory food, and brought it to his father. He said to his father, &ldquo;Let my father arise, and eat of his son&rsquo;s venison, that your soul may bless me.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v32>v32</h6><p>Isaac his father said to him, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v33>v33</h6><p>Isaac trembled violently, and said, &ldquo;Who, then, is he who has taken venison, and brought it to me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? Yes, he will be blessed.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v34>v34</h6><p>When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, &ldquo;Bless me, even me also, my father.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v35>v35</h6><p>He said, &ldquo;Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v36>v36</h6><p>He said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you reserved a blessing for me?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v37>v37</h6><p>Isaac answered Esau, &ldquo;Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants. I have sustained him with grain and new wine. What then will I do for you, my son?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v38>v38</h6><p>Esau said to his father, &ldquo;Do you have just one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, my father.&rdquo; Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.</p><h6 id=v39>v39</h6><p>Isaac his father answered him, &ldquo;Behold, your dwelling will be of the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of the sky from above.</p><h6 id=v40>v40</h6><p>You will live by your sword, and you will serve your brother. It will happen, when you will break loose, that you will shake his yoke from off your neck.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v41>v41</h6><p>Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. Esau said in his heart, &ldquo;The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v42>v42</h6><p>The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, &ldquo;Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you.</p><h6 id=v43>v43</h6><p>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban, my brother, in Haran.</p><h6 id=v44>v44</h6><p>Stay with him a few days, until your brother&rsquo;s fury turns away&ndash;</p><h6 id=v45>v45</h6><p>until your brother&rsquo;s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send, and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v46>v46</h6><p>Rebekah said to Isaac, &ldquo;I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?&rdquo;</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/genesis/gen-26/>Genesis 26</a>
