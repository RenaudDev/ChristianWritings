He took her, lay with her, and humbled her.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>His soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Shechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, &ldquo;Get me this young lady as a wife.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field. Jacob held his peace until they came.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. The men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob&rsquo;s daughter, a thing that ought not to be done.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Hamor talked with them, saying, &ldquo;The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>You shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you.

Let&rsquo;s take their daughters to us for wives, and let&rsquo;s give them our daughters.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people, if every male among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>Won&rsquo;t their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let&rsquo;s give our consent to them, and they will dwell with us.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor, and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>On the third day, when they were sore, two of Jacob&rsquo;s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah&rsquo;s brothers, each took his sword, came upon the unsuspecting city, and killed all the males.</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>They killed Hamor and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem&rsquo;s house, and went away.</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>Jacob&rsquo;s sons came on the dead, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.</p><h6 id=v28>v28</h6><p>They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, that which was in the city, that which was in the field,</p><h6 id=v29>v29</h6><p>and all their wealth. They took captive all their little ones and their wives, and took as plunder everything that was in the house.</p><h6 id=v30>v30</h6><p>Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, &ldquo;You have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number. They will gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v31>v31</h6><p>They said, &ldquo;Should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute?&rdquo;</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/genesis/gen-33/>Genesis 33</a>
