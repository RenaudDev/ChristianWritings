He called the name of that place Mahanaim.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>He commanded them, saying, &ldquo;This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: &lsquo;This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, &ldquo;We came to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, along with the flocks, the herds, and the camels, into two companies.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>He said, &ldquo;If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Jacob said, &ldquo;God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh, who said to me, &lsquo;Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I crossed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and strike me and the mothers with the children.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>You said, &lsquo;I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which can&rsquo;t be counted because there are so many.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>He stayed there that night, and took from that which he had with him a present for Esau, his brother:</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, &ldquo;Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>He commanded the foremost, saying, &ldquo;When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, &lsquo;Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>Then you shall say, &lsquo;They are your servant, Jacob&rsquo;s. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, &ldquo;This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>You shall say, &lsquo;Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.&rsquo;&rdquo; For, he said, &ldquo;I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>So the present passed over before him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day.</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>When he saw that he didn&rsquo;t prevail against him, the man touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob&rsquo;s thigh was strained as he wrestled.</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>The man said, &ldquo;Let me go, for the day breaks.&rdquo; Jacob said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you go unless you bless me.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>He said to him, &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Jacob&rdquo;.</p><h6 id=v28>v28</h6><p>He said, &ldquo;Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v29>v29</h6><p>Jacob asked him, &ldquo;Please tell me your name.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Why is it that you ask what my name is?&rdquo; So he blessed him there.</p><h6 id=v30>v30</h6><p>Jacob called the name of the place Peniel; for he said, &ldquo;I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v31>v31</h6><p>The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh.</p><h6 id=v32>v32</h6><p>Therefore the children of Israel don&rsquo;t eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob&rsquo;s thigh in the sinew of the hip.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/genesis/gen-31/>Genesis 31</a>
