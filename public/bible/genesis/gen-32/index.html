    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>When he saw them, Jacob said, &ldquo;This is God&rsquo;s army.&rdquo; He called the name of that place Mahanaim.</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>He commanded them, saying, &ldquo;This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: &lsquo;This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now.</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, &ldquo;We came to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, along with the flocks, the herds, and the camels, into two companies.</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>He said, &ldquo;If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>Jacob said, &ldquo;God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh, who said to me, &lsquo;Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,&rsquo;</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I crossed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and strike me and the mothers with the children.</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>You said, &lsquo;I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which can&rsquo;t be counted because there are so many.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>He stayed there that night, and took from that which he had with him a present for Esau, his brother:</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, &ldquo;Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>He commanded the foremost, saying, &ldquo;When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, &lsquo;Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?&rsquo;</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>Then you shall say, &lsquo;They are your servant, Jacob&rsquo;s. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, &ldquo;This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him.</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>You shall say, &lsquo;Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.&rsquo;&rdquo; For, he said, &ldquo;I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>So the present passed over before him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok.</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day.</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>When he saw that he didn&rsquo;t prevail against him, the man touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob&rsquo;s thigh was strained as he wrestled.</p>
<h6 id="v26">v26</h6>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;Let me go, for the day breaks.&rdquo; Jacob said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you go unless you bless me.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v27">v27</h6>
<p>He said to him, &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Jacob&rdquo;.</p>
<h6 id="v28">v28</h6>
<p>He said, &ldquo;Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v29">v29</h6>
<p>Jacob asked him, &ldquo;Please tell me your name.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Why is it that you ask what my name is?&rdquo; So he blessed him there.</p>
<h6 id="v30">v30</h6>
<p>Jacob called the name of the place Peniel; for he said, &ldquo;I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v31">v31</h6>
<p>The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh.</p>
<h6 id="v32">v32</h6>
<p>Therefore the children of Israel don&rsquo;t eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob&rsquo;s thigh in the sinew of the hip.</p>
