Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh&rsquo;s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there.</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>Yahweh was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>His master saw that Yahweh was with him, and that Yahweh made all that he did prosper in his hand.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Joseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and Potiphar made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>From the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, Yahweh blessed the Egyptian&rsquo;s house for Joseph&rsquo;s sake. Yahweh&rsquo;s blessing was on all that he had, in the house and in the field.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>He left all that he had in Joseph&rsquo;s hand. He didn&rsquo;t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate. Joseph was well-built and handsome.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>After these things, his master&rsquo;s wife set her eyes on Joseph; and she said, &ldquo;Lie with me.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>But he refused, and said to his master&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;Behold, my master doesn&rsquo;t know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>No one is greater in this house than I am, and he has not kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he didn&rsquo;t listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>About this time, he went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>She caught him by his garment, saying, &ldquo;Lie with me!&rdquo; He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside,</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, &ldquo;Behold, he has brought a Hebrew in to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>When he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>She spoke to him according to these words, saying, &ldquo;The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me,</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>and as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>When his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, &ldquo;This is what your servant did to me,&rdquo; his wrath was kindled.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>Joseph&rsquo;s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king&rsquo;s prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>But Yahweh was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph&rsquo;s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>The keeper of the prison didn&rsquo;t look after anything that was under his hand, because Yahweh was with him; and that which he did, Yahweh made it prosper.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/genesis/gen-38/>Genesis 38</a>
