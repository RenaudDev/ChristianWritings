    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>The famine was severe in the land.</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>When they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, &ldquo;Go again, buy us a little more food.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>Judah spoke to him, saying, &ldquo;The man solemnly warned us, saying, &lsquo;You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.&rsquo;</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>If you&rsquo;ll send our brother with us, we&rsquo;ll go down and buy you food;</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t send him, we won&rsquo;t go down, for the man said to us, &lsquo;You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>Israel said, &ldquo;Why did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had another brother?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>They said, &ldquo;The man asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, &lsquo;Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?&rsquo; We just answered his questions. Is there any way we could know that he would say, &lsquo;Bring your brother down?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>Judah said to Israel, his father, &ldquo;Send the boy with me, and we&rsquo;ll get up and go, so that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones.</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be collateral for him. From my hand will you require him. If I don&rsquo;t bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever;</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>for if we hadn&rsquo;t delayed, surely we would have returned a second time by now.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>Their father, Israel, said to them, &ldquo;If it must be so, then do this: Take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>and take double money in your hand, and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight.</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>Take your brother also, get up, and return to the man.</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>May God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>The men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, &ldquo;Bring the men into the house, and butcher an animal, and prepare; for the men will dine with me at noon.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>The man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph&rsquo;s house.</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph&rsquo;s house; and they said, &ldquo;Because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time, we&rsquo;re brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves, along with our donkeys.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>They came near to the steward of Joseph&rsquo;s house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>and said, &ldquo;Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food.</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>When we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and behold, each man&rsquo;s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in our hand.</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>We have brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We don&rsquo;t know who put our money in our sacks.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>He said, &ldquo;Peace be to you. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money.&rdquo; He brought Simeon out to them.</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>The man brought the men into Joseph&rsquo;s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. He gave their donkeys fodder.</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>They prepared the present for Joseph&rsquo;s coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.</p>
<h6 id="v26">v26</h6>
<p>When Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to the earth before him.</p>
<h6 id="v27">v27</h6>
<p>He asked them of their welfare, and said, &ldquo;Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v28">v28</h6>
<p>They said, &ldquo;Your servant, our father, is well. He is still alive.&rdquo; They bowed down humbly.</p>
<h6 id="v29">v29</h6>
<p>He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother&rsquo;s son, and said, &ldquo;Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;God be gracious to you, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v30">v30</h6>
<p>Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother; and he sought a place to weep. He entered into his room, and wept there.</p>
<h6 id="v31">v31</h6>
<p>He washed his face, and came out. He controlled himself, and said, &ldquo;Serve the meal.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v32">v32</h6>
<p>They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians don&rsquo;t eat with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.</p>
<h6 id="v33">v33</h6>
<p>They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth, and the men marveled with one another.</p>
<h6 id="v34">v34</h6>
<p>He sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin&rsquo;s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. They drank, and were merry with him.</p>
