    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>Jokshan became the father of Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac,</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>but Abraham gave gifts to the sons of Abraham&rsquo;s concubines. While he still lived, he sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward, to the east country.</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>These are the days of the years of Abraham&rsquo;s life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years.</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>Abraham gave up his spirit, and died at a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is near Mamre,</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>the field which Abraham purchased from the children of Heth. Abraham was buried there with Sarah, his wife.</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi.</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham&rsquo;s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah&rsquo;s servant, bore to Abraham.</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>Mishma, Dumah, Massa,</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations.</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>These are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years. He gave up his spirit and died, and was gathered to his people.</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all his relatives.</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham&rsquo;s son. Abraham became the father of Isaac.</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren. Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>The children struggled together within her. She said, &ldquo;If it is like this, why do I live?&rdquo; She went to inquire of Yahweh.</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>Yahweh said to her, &ldquo;Two nations are in your womb. Two peoples will be separated from your body. The one people will be stronger than the other people. The elder will serve the younger.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau.</p>
<h6 id="v26">v26</h6>
<p>After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau&rsquo;s heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.</p>
<h6 id="v27">v27</h6>
<p>The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.</p>
<h6 id="v28">v28</h6>
<p>Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.</p>
<h6 id="v29">v29</h6>
<p>Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.</p>
<h6 id="v30">v30</h6>
<p>Esau said to Jacob, &ldquo;Please feed me with some of that red stew, for I am famished.&rdquo; Therefore his name was called Edom.</p>
<h6 id="v31">v31</h6>
<p>Jacob said, &ldquo;First, sell me your birthright.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v32">v32</h6>
<p>Esau said, &ldquo;Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v33">v33</h6>
<p>Jacob said, &ldquo;Swear to me first.&rdquo; He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob.</p>
<h6 id="v34">v34</h6>
<p>Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.</p>
