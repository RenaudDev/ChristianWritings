The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac,</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>but Abraham gave gifts to the sons of Abraham&rsquo;s concubines. While he still lived, he sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward, to the east country.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>These are the days of the years of Abraham&rsquo;s life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Abraham gave up his spirit, and died at a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is near Mamre,</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>the field which Abraham purchased from the children of Heth. Abraham was buried there with Sarah, his wife.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham&rsquo;s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah&rsquo;s servant, bore to Abraham.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Mishma, Dumah, Massa,</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>These are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years. He gave up his spirit and died, and was gathered to his people.</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all his relatives.</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham&rsquo;s son. Abraham became the father of Isaac.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren. Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>The children struggled together within her. She said, &ldquo;If it is like this, why do I live?&rdquo; She went to inquire of Yahweh.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>Yahweh said to her, &ldquo;Two nations are in your womb. Two peoples will be separated from your body. The one people will be stronger than the other people. The elder will serve the younger.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau.</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau&rsquo;s heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.</p><h6 id=v28>v28</h6><p>Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.</p><h6 id=v29>v29</h6><p>Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.</p><h6 id=v30>v30</h6><p>Esau said to Jacob, &ldquo;Please feed me with some of that red stew, for I am famished.&rdquo; Therefore his name was called Edom.</p><h6 id=v31>v31</h6><p>Jacob said, &ldquo;First, sell me your birthright.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v32>v32</h6><p>Esau said, &ldquo;Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v33>v33</h6><p>Jacob said, &ldquo;Swear to me first.&rdquo; He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob.</p><h6 id=v34>v34</h6><p>Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/genesis/gen-24/>Genesis 24</a>
