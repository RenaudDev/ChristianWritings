    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>The whole earth was of one language and of one speech.</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>As they traveled east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there.</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>They said to one another, &ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.&rdquo; They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>They said, &ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let&rsquo;s make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>Yahweh said, &ldquo;Behold, they are one people, and they all have one language, and this is what they begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>Come, let&rsquo;s go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another&rsquo;s speech.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the city.</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>Therefore its name was called Babel, because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth. From there, Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>This is the history of the generations of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old when he became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood.</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and became the father of more sons and daughters.</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah.</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>Arpachshad lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Shelah, and became the father of more sons and daughters.</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber.</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>Shelah lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Eber, and became the father of more sons and daughters.</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg.</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>Eber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father of Peleg, and became the father of more sons and daughters.</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu.</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>Peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father of Reu, and became the father of more sons and daughters.</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug.</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>Reu lived two hundred seven years after he became the father of Serug, and became the father of more sons and daughters.</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor.</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and became the father of more sons and daughters.</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah.</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and became the father of more sons and daughters.</p>
<h6 id="v26">v26</h6>
<p>Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.</p>
<h6 id="v27">v27</h6>
<p>Now this is the history of the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the father of Lot.</p>
<h6 id="v28">v28</h6>
<p>Haran died in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees, while his father Terah was still alive.</p>
<h6 id="v29">v29</h6>
<p>Abram and Nahor married wives. The name of Abram&rsquo;s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor&rsquo;s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, who was also the father of Iscah.</p>
<h6 id="v30">v30</h6>
<p>Sarai was barren. She had no child.</p>
<h6 id="v31">v31</h6>
<p>Terah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son&rsquo;s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram&rsquo;s wife. They went from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. They came to Haran and lived there.</p>
<h6 id="v32">v32</h6>
<p>The days of Terah were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran.</p>
