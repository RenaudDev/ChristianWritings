Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth,</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>and he said, &ldquo;See now, my lords, please come into your servant&rsquo;s house, stay all night, wash your feet, and you can rise up early, and go on your way.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;No, but we will stay in the street all night.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>They called to Lot, and said to him, &ldquo;Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>Lot went out to them through the door, and shut the door after himself.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>He said, &ldquo;Please, my brothers, don&rsquo;t act so wickedly.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>See now, I have two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only don&rsquo;t do anything to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>They said, &ldquo;Stand back!&rdquo; Then they said, &ldquo;This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now we will deal worse with you than with them!&rdquo; They pressed hard on the man Lot, and came near to break the door.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>But the men reached out their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>They struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>The men said to Lot, &ldquo;Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring them out of the place:</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown so great before Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us to destroy it.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, &ldquo;Get up! Get out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy the city!&rdquo; But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, &ldquo;Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife&rsquo;s hand, and his two daughters&rsquo; hands, Yahweh being merciful to him; and they took him out, and set him outside of the city.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, &ldquo;Escape for your life! Don&rsquo;t look behind you, and don&rsquo;t stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>Lot said to them, &ldquo;Oh, not so, my lord.</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>See now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can&rsquo;t escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (isn&rsquo;t it a little one?), and my soul will live.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>He said to him, &ldquo;Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>Hurry, escape there, for I can&rsquo;t do anything until you get there.&rdquo; Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky.</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>But Lot&rsquo;s wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>Abraham went up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Yahweh.</p><h6 id=v28>v28</h6><p>He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.</p><h6 id=v29>v29</h6><p>When God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.</p><h6 id=v30>v30</h6><p>Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters.</p><h6 id=v31>v31</h6><p>The firstborn said to the younger, &ldquo;Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth.</p><h6 id=v32>v32</h6><p>Come, let&rsquo;s make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father&rsquo;s family line.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v33>v33</h6><p>They made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. He didn&rsquo;t know when she lay down, nor when she arose.</p><h6 id=v34>v34</h6><p>It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, &ldquo;Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let&rsquo;s make him drink wine again tonight. You go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father&rsquo;s family line.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v35>v35</h6><p>They made their father drink wine that night also. The younger went and lay with him. He didn&rsquo;t know when she lay down, nor when she got up.</p><h6 id=v36>v36</h6><p>Thus both of Lot&rsquo;s daughters were with child by their father.</p><h6 id=v37>v37</h6><p>The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day.</p><h6 id=v38>v38</h6><p>The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi. He is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/genesis/gen-18/>Genesis 18</a>
