He lived as a foreigner in Gerar.</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>Abraham said about Sarah his wife, &ldquo;She is my sister.&rdquo; Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, &ldquo;Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a man&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, &ldquo;Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation?</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>Didn&rsquo;t he tell me, &lsquo;She is my sister&rsquo;? She, even she herself, said, &lsquo;He is my brother.&rsquo; I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>God said to him in the dream, &ldquo;Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn&rsquo;t allow you to touch her.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>Now therefore, restore the man&rsquo;s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If you don&rsquo;t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. The men were very scared.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, &ldquo;What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>Abimelech said to Abraham, &ldquo;What did you see, that you have done this thing?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Abraham said, &ldquo;Because I thought, &lsquo;Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my wife&rsquo;s sake.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>When God caused me to wander from my father&rsquo;s house, I said to her, &lsquo;This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, &ldquo;He is my brother.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Abimelech took sheep and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Abimelech said, &ldquo;Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>To Sarah he said, &ldquo;Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>Abraham prayed to God. So God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants, and they bore children.</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>For Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham&rsquo;s wife.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/genesis/gen-19/>Genesis 19</a>
