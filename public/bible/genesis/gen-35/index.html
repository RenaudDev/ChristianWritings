Make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, &ldquo;Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, change your garments.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>Let&rsquo;s arise, and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me on the way which I went.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>They traveled, and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them, and they didn&rsquo;t pursue the sons of Jacob.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>He built an altar there, and called the place El Beth El; because there God was revealed to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Deborah, Rebekah&rsquo;s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and its name was called Allon Bacuth.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan Aram, and blessed him.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>God said to him, &ldquo;Your name is Jacob. Your name shall not be Jacob any more, but your name will be Israel.&rdquo; He named him Israel.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>God said to him, &ldquo;I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations will be from you, and kings will come out of your body.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, and to your offspring after you I will give the land.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him &ldquo;Bethel&rdquo;.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>They traveled from Bethel. There was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel travailed. She had hard labor.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>When she was in hard labor, the midwife said to her, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, for now you will have another son.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>As her soul was departing (for she died), she named him Benoni, but his father named him Benjamin.</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem).</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>Jacob set up a pillar on her grave. The same is the Pillar of Rachel&rsquo;s grave to this day.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>Israel traveled, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father&rsquo;s concubine, and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob&rsquo;s firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>The sons of Bilhah (Rachel&rsquo;s servant): Dan and Naphtali.</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>The sons of Zilpah (Leah&rsquo;s servant): Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram.</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre, to Kiriath Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac lived as foreigners.</p><h6 id=v28>v28</h6><p>The days of Isaac were one hundred eighty years.</p><h6 id=v29>v29</h6><p>Isaac gave up the spirit and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. Esau and Jacob, his sons, buried him.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/genesis/gen-34/>Genesis 34</a>
