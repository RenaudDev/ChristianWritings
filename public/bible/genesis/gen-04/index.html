She conceived, and gave birth to Cain, and said, &ldquo;I have gotten a man with Yahweh&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>Again she gave birth, to Cain&rsquo;s brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>As time passed, Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. Yahweh respected Abel and his offering,</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>but he didn&rsquo;t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>Yahweh said to Cain, &ldquo;Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>If you do well, won&rsquo;t it be lifted up? If you don&rsquo;t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Cain said to Abel, his brother, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go into the field.&rdquo; While they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Yahweh said to Cain, &ldquo;Where is Abel, your brother?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Am I my brother&rsquo;s keeper?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>Yahweh said, &ldquo;What have you done? The voice of your brother&rsquo;s blood cries to me from the ground.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother&rsquo;s blood from your hand.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>From now on, when you till the ground, it won&rsquo;t yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>Cain said to Yahweh, &ldquo;My punishment is greater than I can bear.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Behold, you have driven me out today from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. Whoever finds me will kill me.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Yahweh said to him, &ldquo;Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.&rdquo; Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, so that anyone finding him would not strike him.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>Cain left Yahweh&rsquo;s presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and named the city after the name of his son, Enoch.</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>Irad was born to Enoch. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech.</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>Lamech took two wives: the name of the first one was Adah, and the name of the second one was Zillah.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>His brother&rsquo;s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron. Tubal Cain&rsquo;s sister was Naamah.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>Lamech said to his wives, &ldquo;Adah and Zillah, hear my voice. You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech, for I have slain a man for wounding me, a young man for bruising me.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>If Cain will be avenged seven times, truly Lamech seventy-seven times.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, saying, &ldquo;for God has given me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>A son was also born to Seth, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on Yahweh&rsquo;s name.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/genesis/gen-03/>Genesis 3</a>
