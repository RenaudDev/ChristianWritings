You will be the father of a multitude of nations.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>Your name will no more be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>^f39f4f</p><p>I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you. Kings will come out of you.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your offspring after you.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>^1bbcb2</p><p>I will give to you, and to your offspring after you, the land where you are traveling, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession.
