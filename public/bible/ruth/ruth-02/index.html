She said to her, &ldquo;Go, my daughter.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, &ldquo;May Yahweh be with you.&rdquo; They answered him, &ldquo;May Yahweh bless you.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, &ldquo;Whose young lady is this?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>The servant who was set over the reapers answered, &ldquo;It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>She said, &lsquo;Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.&rsquo; So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she rested a little in the house.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Then Boaz said to Ruth, &ldquo;Listen, my daughter. Don&rsquo;t go to glean in another field, and don&rsquo;t go from here, but stay here close to my maidens.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them. Haven&rsquo;t I commanded the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink from that which the young men have drawn.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, &ldquo;Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, since I am a foreigner?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Boaz answered her, &ldquo;I have been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father, your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn&rsquo;t know before.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>May Yahweh repay your work, and a full reward be given to you from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>Then she said, &ldquo;Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not as one of your servants.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>At meal time Boaz said to her, &ldquo;Come here, and eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.&rdquo; She sat beside the reapers, and they passed her parched grain. She ate, was satisfied, and left some of it.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>When she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, &ldquo;Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don&rsquo;t reproach her.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it. Let her glean, and don&rsquo;t rebuke her.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>She took it up, and went into the city. Then her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she had enough.</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>Her mother-in-law said to her, &ldquo;Where have you gleaned today? Where have you worked? Blessed be he who noticed you.&rdquo; She told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, &ldquo;May he be blessed by Yahweh, who has not abandoned his kindness to the living and to the dead.&rdquo; Naomi said to her, &ldquo;The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>Ruth the Moabitess said, &ldquo;Yes, he said to me, &lsquo;You shall stay close to my young men until they have finished all my harvest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, &ldquo;It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>So she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/ruth/ruth-01/>Ruth 1</a>
