Behold, he will be winnowing barley tonight on the threshing floor.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>Therefore wash yourself, anoint yourself, get dressed, and go down to the threshing floor; but don&rsquo;t make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>It shall be, when he lies down, that you shall note the place where he is lying. Then you shall go in, uncover his feet, and lay down. Then he will tell you what to do.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>She said to her, &ldquo;All that you say, I will do.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>She went down to the threshing floor, and did everything that her mother-in-law told her.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain.
