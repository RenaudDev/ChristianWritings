and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>But Yahweh said to David my father, &lsquo;Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart;</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>nevertheless you shall not build the house;
