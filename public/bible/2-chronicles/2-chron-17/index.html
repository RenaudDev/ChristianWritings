All Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>His heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh. Furthermore, he took away the high places and the Asherah poles out of Judah.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>They taught in Judah, having the book of Yahweh&rsquo;s law with them. They went about throughout all the cities of Judah and taught among the people.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>The fear of Yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute. The Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand seven hundred rams, and seven thousand seven hundred male goats.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>He had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>This was the numbering of them according to their fathers&rsquo; houses: From Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor;</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand;</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to Yahweh, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>From Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>and next to him Jehozabad, and with him one hundred eighty thousand ready and prepared for war.</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>These were those who waited on the king, in addition to those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/2-chronicles/2-chron-16/>2 Chronicles 16</a>
