but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>These were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two-hundred fifty, who ruled over the people.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Solomon brought up Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter out of David&rsquo;s city to the house that he had built for her; for he said, &ldquo;My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places where Yahweh&rsquo;s ark has come are holy.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on Yahweh&rsquo;s altar, which he had built before the porch,</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times per year, during the feast of unleavened bread, during the feast of weeks, and during the feast of booths.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>He appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the divisions of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their divisions at every gate, for David the man of God had so commanded.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>They didn&rsquo;t depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>Now all the work of Solomon was prepared from the day of the foundation of Yahweh&rsquo;s house until it was finished.
