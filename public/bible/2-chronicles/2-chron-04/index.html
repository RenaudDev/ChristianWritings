The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hindquarters were inward.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>It was a handbreadth thick; and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It received and held three thousand baths.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>He also made ten basins, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them.
