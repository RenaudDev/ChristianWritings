his heart rages against Yahweh.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Wealth adds many friends, but the poor is separated from his friend.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>A false witness shall not be unpunished. He who pours out lies shall not go free.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>Many will entreat the favor of a ruler, and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>All the relatives of the poor shun him: how much more do his friends avoid him! He pursues them with pleas, but they are gone.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>He who gets wisdom loves his own soul. He who keeps understanding shall find good.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>A false witness shall not be unpunished.

It is his glory to overlook an offense.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>The king&rsquo;s wrath is like the roaring of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>A foolish son is the calamity of his father. A wife&rsquo;s quarrels are a continual dripping.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>House and riches are an inheritance from fathers, but a prudent wife is from Yahweh.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep. The idle soul shall suffer hunger.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, but he who is contemptuous in his ways shall die.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>He who has pity on the poor lends to Yahweh; he will reward him.</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>Discipline your son, for there is hope; don&rsquo;t be a willing party to his death.</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty, for if you rescue him, you must do it again.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>Listen to counsel and receive instruction, that you may be wise in your latter end.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>There are many plans in a man&rsquo;s heart, but Yahweh&rsquo;s counsel will prevail.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness.
