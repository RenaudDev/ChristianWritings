    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>In the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, I picked up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad before in his presence.</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>The king said to me, &ldquo;Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is nothing else but sorrow of heart.&rdquo; Then I was very much afraid.</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>I said to the king, &ldquo;Let the king live forever! Why shouldn&rsquo;t my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers&rsquo; tombs, lies waste, and its gates have been consumed with fire?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>Then the king said to me, &ldquo;What is your request?&rdquo; So I prayed to the God of heaven.</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>I said to the king, &ldquo;If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers&rsquo; tombs, that I may build it.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>The king said to me (the queen was also sitting by him), &ldquo;How long will your journey be? When will you return?&rdquo; So it pleased the king to send me, and I set a time for him.</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>Moreover I said to the king, &ldquo;If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah;</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king&rsquo;s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple, for the wall of the city, and for the house that I will occupy.&rdquo; The king granted my requests, because of the good hand of my God on me.</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king&rsquo;s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I didn&rsquo;t tell anyone what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There wasn&rsquo;t any animal with me, except the animal that I rode on.</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal&rsquo;s well, then to the dung gate, and inspected the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and its gates were consumed with fire.</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>Then I went on to the spring gate and to the king&rsquo;s pool, but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass.</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>Then I went up in the night by the brook, and inspected the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned.</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>The rulers didn&rsquo;t know where I went, or what I did. I had not as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest who did the work.</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>Then I said to them, &ldquo;You see the bad situation that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come, let&rsquo;s build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we won&rsquo;t be disgraced.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>I told them about the hand of my God which was good on me, and also about the king&rsquo;s words that he had spoken to me. They said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s rise up and build.&rdquo; So they strengthened their hands for the good work.</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite servant, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they ridiculed us, and despised us, and said, &ldquo;What is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>Then I answered them, and said to them, &ldquo;The God of heaven will prosper us. Therefore we, his servants, will arise and build; but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
