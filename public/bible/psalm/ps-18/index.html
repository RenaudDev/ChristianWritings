The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>The cords of Sheol were around me. The snares of death came on me.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>In my distress I called on Yahweh, and cried to my God. He heard my voice out of his temple. My cry before him came into his ears.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>Then the earth shook and trembled. The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken, because he was angry.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Smoke went out of his nostrils. Consuming fire came out of his mouth. Coals were kindled by it.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>He bowed the heavens also, and came down. Thick darkness was under his feet.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>He rode on a cherub, and flew. Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion around him, darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, hailstones and coals of fire.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>Yahweh also thundered in the sky. The Most High uttered his voice: hailstones and coals of fire.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>He sent out his arrows, and scattered them. He routed them with great lightning bolts.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Then the channels of waters appeared. The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, Yahweh, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>He sent from on high. He took me. He drew me out of many waters.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>They came on me in the day of my calamity, but Yahweh was my support.</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>He brought me out also into a large place. He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness. According to the cleanness of my hands, he has recompensed me.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>For all his ordinances were before me. I didn&rsquo;t put away his statutes from me.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>I was also blameless with him. I kept myself from my iniquity.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>With the merciful you will show yourself merciful. With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect.</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>With the pure, you will show yourself pure. With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>For you will save the afflicted people, but the arrogant eyes you will bring down.</p><h6 id=v28>v28</h6><p>For you will light my lamp, Yahweh. My God will light up my darkness.</p><h6 id=v29>v29</h6><p>For by you, I advance through a troop. By my God, I leap over a wall.</p><h6 id=v30>v30</h6><p>As for God, his way is perfect. Yahweh&rsquo;s word is tried. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.</p><h6 id=v31>v31</h6><p>For who is God, except Yahweh? Who is a rock, besides our God,</p><h6 id=v32>v32</h6><p>the God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect?</p><h6 id=v33>v33</h6><p>He makes my feet like deer&rsquo;s feet, and sets me on my high places.</p><h6 id=v34>v34</h6><p>He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of bronze.</p><h6 id=v35>v35</h6><p>You have also given me the shield of your salvation. Your right hand sustains me. Your gentleness has made me great.</p><h6 id=v36>v36</h6><p>You have enlarged my steps under me, My feet have not slipped.</p><h6 id=v37>v37</h6><p>I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them. I won&rsquo;t turn away until they are consumed.</p><h6 id=v38>v38</h6><p>I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise. They shall fall under my feet.</p><h6 id=v39>v39</h6><p>For you have armed me with strength to the battle. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.</p><h6 id=v40>v40</h6><p>You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me.</p><h6 id=v41>v41</h6><p>They cried, but there was no one to save; even to Yahweh, but he didn&rsquo;t answer them.</p><h6 id=v42>v42</h6><p>Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind. I cast them out as the mire of the streets.</p><h6 id=v43>v43</h6><p>You have delivered me from the strivings of the people. You have made me the head of the nations. A people whom I have not known shall serve me.</p><h6 id=v44>v44</h6><p>As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me. The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.</p><h6 id=v45>v45</h6><p>The foreigners shall fade away, and shall come trembling out of their strongholds.</p><h6 id=v46>v46</h6><p>Yahweh lives! Blessed be my rock. Exalted be the God of my salvation,</p><h6 id=v47>v47</h6><p>even the God who executes vengeance for me, and subdues peoples under me.</p><h6 id=v48>v48</h6><p>He rescues me from my enemies. Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me. You deliver me from the violent man.</p><h6 id=v49>v49</h6><p>Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations, and will sing praises to your name.</p><h6 id=v50>v50</h6><p>He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness to his anointed, to David and to his offspring, forever more.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/psalm/ps-17/>Psalm 17</a>
