    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>I love you, Yahweh, my strength.</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>I call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised; and I am saved from my enemies.</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>The cords of death surrounded me. The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>The cords of Sheol were around me. The snares of death came on me.</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>In my distress I called on Yahweh, and cried to my God. He heard my voice out of his temple. My cry before him came into his ears.</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>Then the earth shook and trembled. The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken, because he was angry.</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>Smoke went out of his nostrils. Consuming fire came out of his mouth. Coals were kindled by it.</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>He bowed the heavens also, and came down. Thick darkness was under his feet.</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>He rode on a cherub, and flew. Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion around him, darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, hailstones and coals of fire.</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>Yahweh also thundered in the sky. The Most High uttered his voice: hailstones and coals of fire.</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>He sent out his arrows, and scattered them. He routed them with great lightning bolts.</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>Then the channels of waters appeared. The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, Yahweh, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>He sent from on high. He took me. He drew me out of many waters.</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>They came on me in the day of my calamity, but Yahweh was my support.</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>He brought me out also into a large place. He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness. According to the cleanness of my hands, he has recompensed me.</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>For all his ordinances were before me. I didn&rsquo;t put away his statutes from me.</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>I was also blameless with him. I kept myself from my iniquity.</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>With the merciful you will show yourself merciful. With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect.</p>
<h6 id="v26">v26</h6>
<p>With the pure, you will show yourself pure. With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.</p>
<h6 id="v27">v27</h6>
<p>For you will save the afflicted people, but the arrogant eyes you will bring down.</p>
<h6 id="v28">v28</h6>
<p>For you will light my lamp, Yahweh. My God will light up my darkness.</p>
<h6 id="v29">v29</h6>
<p>For by you, I advance through a troop. By my God, I leap over a wall.</p>
<h6 id="v30">v30</h6>
<p>As for God, his way is perfect. Yahweh&rsquo;s word is tried. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.</p>
<h6 id="v31">v31</h6>
<p>For who is God, except Yahweh? Who is a rock, besides our God,</p>
<h6 id="v32">v32</h6>
<p>the God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect?</p>
<h6 id="v33">v33</h6>
<p>He makes my feet like deer&rsquo;s feet, and sets me on my high places.</p>
<h6 id="v34">v34</h6>
<p>He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of bronze.</p>
<h6 id="v35">v35</h6>
<p>You have also given me the shield of your salvation. Your right hand sustains me. Your gentleness has made me great.</p>
<h6 id="v36">v36</h6>
<p>You have enlarged my steps under me, My feet have not slipped.</p>
<h6 id="v37">v37</h6>
<p>I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them. I won&rsquo;t turn away until they are consumed.</p>
<h6 id="v38">v38</h6>
<p>I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise. They shall fall under my feet.</p>
<h6 id="v39">v39</h6>
<p>For you have armed me with strength to the battle. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.</p>
<h6 id="v40">v40</h6>
<p>You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me.</p>
<h6 id="v41">v41</h6>
<p>They cried, but there was no one to save; even to Yahweh, but he didn&rsquo;t answer them.</p>
<h6 id="v42">v42</h6>
<p>Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind. I cast them out as the mire of the streets.</p>
<h6 id="v43">v43</h6>
<p>You have delivered me from the strivings of the people. You have made me the head of the nations. A people whom I have not known shall serve me.</p>
<h6 id="v44">v44</h6>
<p>As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me. The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.</p>
<h6 id="v45">v45</h6>
<p>The foreigners shall fade away, and shall come trembling out of their strongholds.</p>
<h6 id="v46">v46</h6>
<p>Yahweh lives! Blessed be my rock. Exalted be the God of my salvation,</p>
<h6 id="v47">v47</h6>
<p>even the God who executes vengeance for me, and subdues peoples under me.</p>
<h6 id="v48">v48</h6>
<p>He rescues me from my enemies. Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me. You deliver me from the violent man.</p>
<h6 id="v49">v49</h6>
<p>Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations, and will sing praises to your name.</p>
<h6 id="v50">v50</h6>
<p>He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness to his anointed, to David and to his offspring, forever more.</p>
