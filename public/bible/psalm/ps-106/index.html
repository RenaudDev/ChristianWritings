    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>Praise Yahweh! Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever.</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh, or fully declare all his praise?</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>Blessed are those who keep justice. Blessed is one who does what is right at all times.</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>Remember me, Yahweh, with the favor that you show to your people. Visit me with your salvation,</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>that I may see the prosperity of your chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with your inheritance.</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>We have sinned with our fathers. We have committed iniquity. We have done wickedly.</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>Our fathers didn&rsquo;t understand your wonders in Egypt. They didn&rsquo;t remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses, but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>Nevertheless he saved them for his name&rsquo;s sake, that he might make his mighty power known.</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>He saved them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>The waters covered their adversaries. There was not one of them left.</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>Then they believed his words. They sang his praise.</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>They soon forgot his works. They didn&rsquo;t wait for his counsel,</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>but gave in to craving in the desert, and tested God in the wasteland.</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron, Yahweh&rsquo;s saint.</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>A fire was kindled in their company. The flame burned up the wicked.</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped a molten image.</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>Thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull that eats grass.</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome things by the Red Sea.</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn&rsquo;t destroy them.</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>Yes, they despised the pleasant land. They didn&rsquo;t believe his word,</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>but murmured in their tents, and didn&rsquo;t listen to Yahweh&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<h6 id="v26">v26</h6>
<p>Therefore he swore to them that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,</p>
<h6 id="v27">v27</h6>
<p>that he would overthrow their offspring among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.</p>
<h6 id="v28">v28</h6>
<p>They joined themselves also to Baal Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p>
<h6 id="v29">v29</h6>
<p>Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds. The plague broke in on them.</p>
<h6 id="v30">v30</h6>
<p>Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgment, so the plague was stopped.</p>
<h6 id="v31">v31</h6>
<p>That was credited to him for righteousness, for all generations to come.</p>
<h6 id="v32">v32</h6>
<p>They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;</p>
<h6 id="v33">v33</h6>
<p>because they were rebellious against his spirit, he spoke rashly with his lips.</p>
<h6 id="v34">v34</h6>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t destroy the peoples, as Yahweh commanded them,</p>
<h6 id="v35">v35</h6>
<p>but mixed themselves with the nations, and learned their works.</p>
<h6 id="v36">v36</h6>
<p>They served their idols, which became a snare to them.</p>
<h6 id="v37">v37</h6>
<p>Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.</p>
<h6 id="v38">v38</h6>
<p>They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. The land was polluted with blood.</p>
<h6 id="v39">v39</h6>
<p>Thus they were defiled with their works, and prostituted themselves in their deeds.</p>
<h6 id="v40">v40</h6>
<p>Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people. He abhorred his inheritance.</p>
<h6 id="v41">v41</h6>
<p>He gave them into the hand of the nations. Those who hated them ruled over them.</p>
<h6 id="v42">v42</h6>
<p>Their enemies also oppressed them. They were brought into subjection under their hand.</p>
<h6 id="v43">v43</h6>
<p>He rescued them many times, but they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity.</p>
<h6 id="v44">v44</h6>
<p>Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry.</p>
<h6 id="v45">v45</h6>
<p>He remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.</p>
<h6 id="v46">v46</h6>
<p>He made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive.</p>
<h6 id="v47">v47</h6>
<p>Save us, Yahweh, our God, gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, to triumph in your praise!</p>
<h6 id="v48">v48</h6>
<p>Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting! Let all the people say, &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; Praise Yah!</p>
