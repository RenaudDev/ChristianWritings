Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>I will open my mouth in a parable. I will utter dark sayings of old,</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>For he established a covenant in Jacob, and appointed a teaching in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born; who should arise and tell their children,</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>that they might set their hope in God, and not forget God&rsquo;s deeds, but keep his commandments,</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that didn&rsquo;t make their hearts loyal, whose spirit was not steadfast with God.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>They didn&rsquo;t keep God&rsquo;s covenant, and refused to walk in his law.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>They forgot his doings, his wondrous deeds that he had shown them.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>He split the sea, and caused them to pass through. He made the waters stand as a heap.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, and all night with a light of fire.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>Yet they still went on to sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>They tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire.</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>Yes, they spoke against God. They said, &ldquo;Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed. Can he give bread also? Will he provide meat for his people?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry. A fire was kindled against Jacob, anger also went up against Israel,</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>because they didn&rsquo;t believe in God, and didn&rsquo;t trust in his salvation.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>He rained down manna on them to eat, and gave them food from the sky.</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>Man ate the bread of angels. He sent them food to the full.</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>He caused the east wind to blow in the sky. By his power he guided the south wind.</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>He also rained meat on them as the dust, winged birds as the sand of the seas.</p><h6 id=v28>v28</h6><p>He let them fall in the middle of their camp, around their habitations.</p><h6 id=v29>v29</h6><p>So they ate, and were well filled. He gave them their own desire.</p><h6 id=v30>v30</h6><p>They didn&rsquo;t turn from their cravings. Their food was yet in their mouths,</p><h6 id=v31>v31</h6><p>when the anger of God went up against them, killed some of their fattest, and struck down the young men of Israel.</p><h6 id=v32>v32</h6><p>For all this they still sinned, and didn&rsquo;t believe in his wondrous works.</p><h6 id=v33>v33</h6><p>Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.</p><h6 id=v34>v34</h6><p>When he killed them, then they inquired after him. They returned and sought God earnestly.</p><h6 id=v35>v35</h6><p>They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God, their redeemer.</p><h6 id=v36>v36</h6><p>But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.</p><h6 id=v37>v37</h6><p>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they faithful in his covenant.</p><h6 id=v38>v38</h6><p>But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn&rsquo;t destroy them. Yes, many times he turned his anger away, and didn&rsquo;t stir up all his wrath.</p><h6 id=v39>v39</h6><p>He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away, and doesn&rsquo;t come again.</p><h6 id=v40>v40</h6><p>How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and grieved him in the desert!</p><h6 id=v41>v41</h6><p>They turned again and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.</p><h6 id=v42>v42</h6><p>They didn&rsquo;t remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;</p><h6 id=v43>v43</h6><p>how he set his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan,</p><h6 id=v44>v44</h6><p>he turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.</p><h6 id=v45>v45</h6><p>He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</p><h6 id=v46>v46</h6><p>He also gave their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.</p><h6 id=v47>v47</h6><p>He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig trees with frost.</p><h6 id=v48>v48</h6><p>He also gave over their livestock to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p><h6 id=v49>v49</h6><p>He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, and a band of angels of evil.</p><h6 id=v50>v50</h6><p>He made a path for his anger. He didn&rsquo;t spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,</p><h6 id=v51>v51</h6><p>and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.</p><h6 id=v52>v52</h6><p>But he led out his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p><h6 id=v53>v53</h6><p>He led them safely, so that they weren&rsquo;t afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p><h6 id=v54>v54</h6><p>He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.</p><h6 id=v55>v55</h6><p>He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p><h6 id=v56>v56</h6><p>Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and didn&rsquo;t keep his testimonies,</p><h6 id=v57>v57</h6><p>but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were twisted like a deceitful bow.</p><h6 id=v58>v58</h6><p>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.</p><h6 id=v59>v59</h6><p>When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel,</p><h6 id=v60>v60</h6><p>so that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men,</p><h6 id=v61>v61</h6><p>and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into the adversary&rsquo;s hand.</p><h6 id=v62>v62</h6><p>He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance.</p><h6 id=v63>v63</h6><p>Fire devoured their young men. Their virgins had no wedding song.</p><h6 id=v64>v64</h6><p>Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn&rsquo;t weep.</p><h6 id=v65>v65</h6><p>Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.</p><h6 id=v66>v66</h6><p>He struck his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach.</p><h6 id=v67>v67</h6><p>Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn&rsquo;t choose the tribe of Ephraim,</p><h6 id=v68>v68</h6><p>But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved.</p><h6 id=v69>v69</h6><p>He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever.</p><h6 id=v70>v70</h6><p>He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;</p><h6 id=v71>v71</h6><p>from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.</p><h6 id=v72>v72</h6><p>So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/psalm/ps-77/>Psalm 77</a>
