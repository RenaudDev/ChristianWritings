Every precious stone adorned you: ruby, topaz, emerald, chrysolite, onyx, jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and beryl. Gold work of tambourines and of pipes was in you. They were prepared in the day that you were created.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>You were the anointed cherub who covers. Then I set you up on the holy mountain of God. You have walked up and down in the middle of the stones of fire.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created, until unrighteousness was found in you.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>By the abundance of your commerce, your insides were filled with violence, and you have sinned. Therefore I have cast you as profane out of God&rsquo;s mountain. I have destroyed you, covering cherub, from the middle of the stones of fire.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty. You have corrupted your wisdom by reason of your splendor. I have cast you to the ground. I have laid you before kings, that they may see you.</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>By the multitude of your iniquities, in the unrighteousness of your commerce, you have profaned your sanctuaries. Therefore I have brought out a fire from the middle of you. It has devoured you. I have turned you to ashes on the earth in the sight of all those who see you.</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>All those who know you among the peoples will be astonished at you. You have become a terror, and you will exist no more.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>Yahweh&rsquo;s word came to me, saying,</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>&ldquo;Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against it,</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>and say, &lsquo;The Lord Yahweh says: &ldquo;Behold, I am against you, Sidon. I will be glorified among you. Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I have executed judgments in her, and am sanctified in her.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>For I will send pestilence into her, and blood into her streets. The wounded will fall within her, with the sword on her on every side. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;&ldquo;There will be no more a pricking brier to the house of Israel, nor a hurting thorn of any that are around them that scorned them. Then they will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Lord Yahweh says: &ldquo;When I have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and am sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then they will dwell in their own land which I gave to my servant Jacob.</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>They will dwell in it securely. Yes, they will build houses, plant vineyards, and will dwell securely, when I have executed judgments on all those who scorn them all around.
