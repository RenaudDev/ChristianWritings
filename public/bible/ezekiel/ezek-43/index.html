There was a wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed. Therefore I have consumed them in my anger.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Now let them put away their prostitution, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me. Then I will dwell among them forever.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>&ldquo;You, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>If they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the form of the house, and its fashion, and its exits, and its entrances, and all its forms, and all its ordinances, and all its forms, and all its laws; and write it in their sight; that they may keep the whole form of it, and all its ordinances, and do them.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>&ldquo;This is the law of the house.

They shall also prepare a young bull, and a ram out of the flock, without defect.</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it. So shall they consecrate it.</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>When they have accomplished the days, it shall be that on the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings.
