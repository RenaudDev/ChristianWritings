They will stand on the land,</p><h6 id=v30>v30</h6><p>and will cause their voice to be heard over you, and will cry bitterly. They will cast up dust on their heads. They will wallow in the ashes.</p><h6 id=v31>v31</h6><p>They will make themselves bald for you, and clothe themselves with sackcloth. They will weep for you in bitterness of soul, with bitter mourning.</p><h6 id=v32>v32</h6><p>In their wailing they will take up a lamentation for you, and lament over you, saying, &lsquo;Who is there like Tyre, like her who is brought to silence in the middle of the sea?&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v33>v33</h6><p>When your wares went out of the seas, you filled many peoples. You enriched the kings of the earth with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise.</p><h6 id=v34>v34</h6><p>In the time that you were broken by the seas, in the depths of the waters, your merchandise and all your company fell within you.</p><h6 id=v35>v35</h6><p>All the inhabitants of the islands are astonished at you, and their kings are horribly afraid. They are troubled in their face.</p><h6 id=v36>v36</h6><p>The merchants among the peoples hiss at you. You have become a terror, and you will be no more.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/ezekiel/ezek-26/>Ezekiel 26</a>
