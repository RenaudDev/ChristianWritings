He shall not live. He has done all these abominations. He shall surely die.

None of his righteous deeds that he has done will be remembered. In his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in them he shall die.</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>&ldquo;Yet you say, &lsquo;The way of the Lord is not equal.&rsquo; Hear now, house of Israel: Is my way not equal? Aren&rsquo;t your ways unequal?</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>When the righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies therein; in his iniquity that he has done he shall die.</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>Again, when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he will save his soul alive.</p><h6 id=v28>v28</h6><p>Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live. He shall not die.</p><h6 id=v29>v29</h6><p>Yet the house of Israel says, &lsquo;The way of the Lord is not fair.&rsquo; House of Israel, aren&rsquo;t my ways fair? Aren&rsquo;t your ways unfair?</p><h6 id=v30>v30</h6><p>&ldquo;Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, everyone according to his ways,&rdquo; says the Lord Yahweh. &ldquo;Return, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity will not be your ruin.</p><h6 id=v31>v31</h6><p>Cast away from you all your transgressions, in which you have transgressed; and make yourself a new heart and a new spirit: for why will you die, house of Israel?</p><h6 id=v32>v32</h6><p>For I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies,&rdquo; says the Lord Yahweh. &ldquo;Therefore turn yourselves, and live!</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/ezekiel/ezek-17/>Ezekiel 17</a>
