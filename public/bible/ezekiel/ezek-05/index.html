You shall take a third part, and strike with the sword around it. A third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>You shall take of it a few in number, and bind them in the folds of your robe.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Of these again you shall take, and cast them into the middle of the fire, and burn them in the fire. From it a fire will come out into all the house of Israel.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>&ldquo;The Lord Yahweh says: &lsquo;This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the middle of the nations, and countries are around her.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>She has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her; for they have rejected my ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>&ldquo;Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: &lsquo;Because you are more turbulent than the nations that are around you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my ordinances, neither have followed the ordinances of the nations that are around you;</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>therefore the Lord Yahweh says: &lsquo;Behold, I, even I, am against you; and I will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>I will do in you that which I have not done, and which I will not do anything like it any more, because of all your abominations.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>Therefore the fathers will eat the sons within you, and the sons will eat their fathers.
