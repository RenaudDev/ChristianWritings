words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul,</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>and he said: &ldquo;Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine;</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>God is my rock in whom I take refuge; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge. My savior, you save me from violence.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>I call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised; So shall I be saved from my enemies.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>For the waves of death surrounded me. The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>The cords of Sheol were around me. The snares of death caught me.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>In my distress, I called on Yahweh. Yes, I called to my God. He heard my voice out of his temple. My cry came into his ears.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Then the earth shook and trembled. The foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken, because he was angry.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Smoke went up out of his nostrils. Consuming fire came out of his mouth. Coals were kindled by it.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>He bowed the heavens also, and came down. Thick darkness was under his feet.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>He rode on a cherub, and flew. Yes, he was seen on the wings of the wind.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>He made darkness a shelter around himself: gathering of waters, and thick clouds of the skies.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>At the brightness before him, coals of fire were kindled.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Yahweh thundered from heaven. The Most High uttered his voice.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>He sent out arrows and scattered them, lightning and confused them.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>Then the channels of the sea appeared. The foundations of the world were laid bare by Yahweh&rsquo;s rebuke, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>He sent from on high and he took me. He drew me out of many waters.</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>They came on me in the day of my calamity, but Yahweh was my support.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>He also brought me out into a large place. He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness. He rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>For I have kept Yahweh&rsquo;s ways, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>For all his ordinances were before me. As for his statutes, I didn&rsquo;t depart from them.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>I was also perfect toward him. I kept myself from my iniquity.</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in his eyesight.</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>With the merciful you will show yourself merciful. With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect.</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>With the pure you will show yourself pure. With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.</p><h6 id=v28>v28</h6><p>You will save the afflicted people, But your eyes are on the arrogant, that you may bring them down.</p><h6 id=v29>v29</h6><p>For you are my lamp, Yahweh. Yahweh will light up my darkness.</p><h6 id=v30>v30</h6><p>For by you, I run against a troop. By my God, I leap over a wall.</p><h6 id=v31>v31</h6><p>As for God, his way is perfect. Yahweh&rsquo;s word is tested. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.</p><h6 id=v32>v32</h6><p>For who is God, besides Yahweh? Who is a rock, besides our God?</p><h6 id=v33>v33</h6><p>God is my strong fortress. He makes my way perfect.</p><h6 id=v34>v34</h6><p>He makes his feet like hinds&rsquo; feet, and sets me on my high places.</p><h6 id=v35>v35</h6><p>He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of bronze.</p><h6 id=v36>v36</h6><p>You have also given me the shield of your salvation. Your gentleness has made me great.</p><h6 id=v37>v37</h6><p>You have enlarged my steps under me. My feet have not slipped.</p><h6 id=v38>v38</h6><p>I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them. I didn&rsquo;t turn again until they were consumed.</p><h6 id=v39>v39</h6><p>I have consumed them, and struck them through, so that they can&rsquo;t arise. Yes, they have fallen under my feet.</p><h6 id=v40>v40</h6><p>For you have armed me with strength for the battle. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.</p><h6 id=v41>v41</h6><p>You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me.</p><h6 id=v42>v42</h6><p>They looked, but there was no one to save; even to Yahweh, but he didn&rsquo;t answer them.</p><h6 id=v43>v43</h6><p>Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth. I crushed them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad.</p><h6 id=v44>v44</h6><p>You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people. You have kept me to be the head of the nations. A people whom I have not known will serve me.</p><h6 id=v45>v45</h6><p>The foreigners will submit themselves to me. As soon as they hear of me, they will obey me.</p><h6 id=v46>v46</h6><p>The foreigners will fade away, and will come trembling out of their close places.</p><h6 id=v47>v47</h6><p>Yahweh lives! Blessed be my rock! Exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,</p><h6 id=v48>v48</h6><p>even the God who executes vengeance for me, who brings down peoples under me,</p><h6 id=v49>v49</h6><p>who brings me away from my enemies. Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me. You deliver me from the violent man.</p><h6 id=v50>v50</h6><p>Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations, and will sing praises to your name.</p><h6 id=v51>v51</h6><p>He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness to his anointed, to David and to his offspring, forever more.&rdquo;</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/2-samuel/2-sam-21/>2 Samuel 21</a>
