    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>At the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem.</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>At evening, David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king&rsquo;s house. From the roof, he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to look at.</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>David sent and inquired after the woman. One said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, Uriah the Hittite&rsquo;s wife?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her house.</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, &ldquo;I am with child.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>David sent to Joab, &ldquo;Send me Uriah the Hittite.&rdquo; Joab sent Uriah to David.</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>When Uriah had come to him, David asked him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>David said to Uriah, &ldquo;Go down to your house and wash your feet.&rdquo; Uriah departed out of the king&rsquo;s house, and a gift from the king was sent after him.</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>But Uriah slept at the door of the king&rsquo;s house with all the servants of his lord, and didn&rsquo;t go down to his house.</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>When they had told David, saying, &ldquo;Uriah didn&rsquo;t go down to his house,&rdquo; David said to Uriah, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you come from a journey? Why didn&rsquo;t you go down to your house?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>Uriah said to David, &ldquo;The ark, Israel, and Judah, are staying in tents; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go into my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing!&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>David said to Uriah, &ldquo;Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.&rdquo; So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>When David had called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk. At evening, he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn&rsquo;t go down to his house.</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>In the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>He wrote in the letter, saying, &ldquo;Send Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck, and die.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>When Joab kept watch on the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab. Some of the people fell, even of David&rsquo;s servants; and Uriah the Hittite died also.</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>and he commanded the messenger, saying, &ldquo;When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king,</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>it shall be that, if the king&rsquo;s wrath arise, and he asks you, &lsquo;Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Didn&rsquo;t you know that they would shoot from the wall?</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn&rsquo;t a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?&rsquo; then you shall say, &lsquo;Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>The messenger said to David, &ldquo;The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate.</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king&rsquo;s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>Then David said to the messenger, &ldquo;Tell Joab, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it.&rsquo; Encourage him.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v26">v26</h6>
<p>When Uriah&rsquo;s wife heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.</p>
<h6 id="v27">v27</h6>
<p>When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Yahweh.</p>
