Ziklag;</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>on the third day, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and earth on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the earth, and showed respect.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>David said to him, &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo; He said to him, &ldquo;I have escaped out of the camp of Israel.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>David said to him, &ldquo;How did it go? Please tell me.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead. Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>David said to the young man who told him, &ldquo;How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>The young man who told him said, &ldquo;As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed close behind him.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, &lsquo;Here I am.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>He said to me, &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; I answered him, &lsquo;I am an Amalekite.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>He said to me, &lsquo;Please stand beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life lingers in me.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and all the men who were with him did likewise.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>They mourned, wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel; because they had fallen by the sword.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>David said to the young man who told him, &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>David said to him, &ldquo;Why were you not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy Yahweh&rsquo;s anointed?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>David called one of the young men, and said, &ldquo;Go near, and cut him down!&rdquo; He struck him so that he died.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>David said to him, &ldquo;Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, &lsquo;I have slain Yahweh&rsquo;s anointed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>(and he commanded them to teach the children of Judah the song of the bow; behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>&ldquo;Your glory, Israel, was slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>Don&rsquo;t tell it in Gath. Don&rsquo;t publish it in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew or rain on you, and no fields of offerings; For there the shield of the mighty was defiled and cast away, The shield of Saul was not anointed with oil.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, Jonathan&rsquo;s bow didn&rsquo;t turn back. Saul&rsquo;s sword didn&rsquo;t return empty.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives. In their death, they were not divided. They were swifter than eagles. They were stronger than lions.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you delicately in scarlet, who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>How the mighty have fallen in the middle of the battle! Jonathan was slain on your high places.</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan. You have been very pleasant to me. Your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>How the mighty have fallen, and the weapons of war have perished!&rdquo;</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/2-samuel/2-sam-02/>2 Samuel 2</a></div></div><footer><article>Copyright © 2021-2022 by Renaud Gagne</article></footer></main></body></html>
