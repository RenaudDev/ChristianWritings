The people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Jehoash said to the priests, &ldquo;All the money of the holy things that is brought into Yahweh&rsquo;s house, in current money, the money of the people for whom each man is evaluated, and all the money that it comes into any man&rsquo;s heart to bring into Yahweh&rsquo;s house,</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>let the priests take it to them, each man from his donor; and they shall repair the damage to the house, wherever any damage is found.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>But it was so, that in the twenty-third year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the damage to the house.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests, and said to them, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you repair the damage to the house? Now therefore take no more money from your treasurers, but deliver it for repair of the damage to the house.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>The priests consented that they should take no more money from the people, and not repair the damage to the house.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into Yahweh&rsquo;s house; and the priests who kept the threshold put all the money that was brought into Yahweh&rsquo;s house into it.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>When they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king&rsquo;s scribe and the high priest came up, and they put it in bags and counted the money that was found in Yahweh&rsquo;s house.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>They gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of Yahweh&rsquo;s house; and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, who worked on Yahweh&rsquo;s house,</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>and to the masons and the stone cutters, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the damage to Yahweh&rsquo;s house, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>But there were not made for Yahweh&rsquo;s house cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into Yahweh&rsquo;s house;</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>for they gave that to those who did the work, and repaired Yahweh&rsquo;s house with it.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Moreover they didn&rsquo;t demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work; for they dealt faithfully.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>The money for the trespass offerings, and the money for the sin offerings was not brought into Yahweh&rsquo;s house.
