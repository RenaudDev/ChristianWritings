army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>The Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman&rsquo;s wife.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>She said to her mistress, &ldquo;I wish that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would heal him of his leprosy.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Someone went in, and told his lord, saying, &ldquo;The maiden who is from the land of Israel said this.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>The king of Syria said, &ldquo;Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.&rdquo; He departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothing.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, &ldquo;Now when this letter has come to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>When the king of Israel had read the letter, he tore his clothes, and said, &ldquo;Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy? But please consider and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>It was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, &ldquo;Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, &ldquo;Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, &ldquo;Behold, I thought, &lsquo;He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leper.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>Aren&rsquo;t Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn&rsquo;t I wash in them, and be clean?&rdquo; So he turned and went away in a rage.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>His servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, &ldquo;My father, if the prophet had asked you do some great thing, wouldn&rsquo;t you have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you, &lsquo;Wash, and be clean?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>He returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, &ldquo;See now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, please take a gift from your servant.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>But he said, &ldquo;As Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none.&rdquo; He urged him to take it; but he refused.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>Naaman said, &ldquo;If not, then, please let two mules&rsquo; burden of earth be given to your servant; for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to Yahweh.</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>In this thing may Yahweh pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon. When I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, may Yahweh pardon your servant in this thing.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>He said to him, &ldquo;Go in peace.&rdquo; So he departed from him a little way.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, &ldquo;Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As Yahweh lives, I will run after him, and take something from him.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>So Gehazi followed after Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him, and said, &ldquo;Is all well?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>He said, &ldquo;All is well. My master has sent me, saying, &lsquo;Behold, even now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>Naaman said, &ldquo;Be pleased to take two talents.&rdquo; He urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants; and they carried them before him.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and stored them in the house. Then he let the men go, and they departed.</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>But he went in, and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, &ldquo;Where did you come from, Gehazi?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Your servant went nowhere.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>He said to him, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t my heart go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves and vineyards, and sheep and cattle, and male servants and female servants?</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>Therefore the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and to your offspring forever.&rdquo; He went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/2-kings/2-kings-04/>2 Kings 4</a>
