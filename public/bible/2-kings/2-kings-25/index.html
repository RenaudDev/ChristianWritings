and they built forts against it around it.</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>On the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king&rsquo;s garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city around it); and the king went by the way of the Arabah.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>But the Chaldean army pursued the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>Then they captured the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they passed judgment on him.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>They killed Zedekiah&rsquo;s sons before his eyes, then put out Zedekiah&rsquo;s eyes, bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>He burned Yahweh&rsquo;s house, the king&rsquo;s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, he burned with fire.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls around Jerusalem.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>The Chaldeans broke up the pillars of bronze that were in Yahweh&rsquo;s house and the bases and the bronze sea that were in Yahweh&rsquo;s house, and carried the bronze pieces to Babylon.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>They took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the spoons, and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>The captain of the guard took away the fire pans, the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for Yahweh&rsquo;s house, the bronze of all these vessels was not weighed.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of bronze was on it.
