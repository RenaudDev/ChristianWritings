I have seen your tears. Behold, I will heal you. On the third day, you will go up to Yahweh&rsquo;s house.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>I will add to your days fifteen years.

No, but let the shadow return backward ten steps.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Isaiah the prophet cried to Yahweh; and he brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the sundial of Ahaz.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>At that time Berodach Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all the storehouse of his precious things, the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, or in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn&rsquo;t show them.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and said to him, &ldquo;What did these men say? From where did they come to you?&rdquo; Hezekiah said, &ldquo;They have come from a far country, even from Babylon.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>He said, &ldquo;What have they seen in your house?&rdquo; Hezekiah answered, &ldquo;They have seen all that is in my house.
