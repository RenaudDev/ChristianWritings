    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>When Yahweh was about to take Elijah up by a whirlwind into heaven, Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>Elijah said to Elisha, &ldquo;Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me as far as Bethel.&rdquo; Elisha said, &ldquo;As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.&rdquo; So they went down to Bethel.</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, &ldquo;Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>Elijah said to him, &ldquo;Elisha, please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.&rdquo; So they came to Jericho.</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, &ldquo;Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>Elijah said to him, &ldquo;Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.&rdquo; Then they both went on.</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both stood by the Jordan.</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>Elijah took his mantle, and rolled it up, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they both went over on dry ground.</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>When they had gone over, Elijah said to Elisha, &ldquo;Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.&rdquo; Elisha said, &ldquo;Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>He said, &ldquo;You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it will be so for you; but if not, it will not be so.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>As they continued on and talked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them, and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>Elisha saw it, and he cried, &ldquo;My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!&rdquo; He saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces.</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>He also took up Elijah&rsquo;s mantle that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>He took Elijah&rsquo;s mantle that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, &ldquo;Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?&rdquo; When he also had struck the waters, they were divided apart, and Elisha went over.</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho facing him saw him, they said, &ldquo;The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.&rdquo; They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>They said to him, &ldquo;See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. Perhaps Yahweh&rsquo;s Spirit has taken him up, and put him on some mountain, or into some valley.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t send them.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, &ldquo;Send them.&rdquo; Therefore they sent fifty men; and they searched for three days, but didn&rsquo;t find him.</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>They came back to him, while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>The men of the city said to Elisha, &ldquo;Behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is barren.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>He said, &ldquo;Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.&rdquo; Then they brought it to him.</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>He went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, &ldquo;Yahweh says, &lsquo;I have healed these waters. There shall not be from there any more death or barren wasteland.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>So the waters were healed to this day, according to Elisha&rsquo;s word which he spoke.</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>He went up from there to Bethel. As he was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city and mocked him, and said to him, &ldquo;Go up, you baldy! Go up, you baldy!&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in Yahweh&rsquo;s name. Then two female bears came out of the woods, and mauled forty-two of those youths.</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</p>
