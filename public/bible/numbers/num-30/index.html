he shall not break his word. He shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>&ldquo;Also, when a woman vows a vow to Yahweh and binds herself by a pledge, being in her father&rsquo;s house, in her youth,</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>and her father hears her vow and her pledge with which she has bound her soul, and her father says nothing to her, then all her vows shall stand, and every pledge with which she has bound her soul shall stand.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>But if her father forbids her in the day that he hears, none of her vows or of her pledges with which she has bound her soul, shall stand. Yahweh will forgive her, because her father has forbidden her.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>&ldquo;If she has a husband, while her vows are on her, or the rash utterance of her lips with which she has bound her soul,</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>and her husband hears it, and says nothing to her in the day that he hears it; then her vows shall stand, and her pledges with which she has bound her soul shall stand.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>But if her husband forbids her in the day that he hears it, then he makes void her vow which is on her and the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul.
