Hasn&rsquo;t he spoken also with us?&rdquo; And Yahweh heard it.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>Now the man Moses was very humble, more than all the men who were on the surface of the earth.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Yahweh spoke suddenly to Moses, to Aaron, and to Miriam, &ldquo;You three come out to the Tent of Meeting!&rdquo; The three of them came out.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>He said, &ldquo;Now hear my words. If there is a prophet among you, I, Yahweh, will make myself known to him in a vision. I will speak with him in a dream.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>My servant Moses is not so.
