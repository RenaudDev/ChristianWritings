    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>All the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron. The whole congregation said to them, &ldquo;We wish that we had died in the land of Egypt, or that we had died in this wilderness!</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>Why does Yahweh bring us to this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be captured or killed! Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better for us to return into Egypt?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>They said to one another, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s choose a leader, and let&rsquo;s return into Egypt.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes.</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>They spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, &ldquo;The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land.</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>If Yahweh delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us: a land which flows with milk and honey.</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>Only don&rsquo;t rebel against Yahweh, neither fear the people of the land; for they are bread for us. Their defense is removed from over them, and Yahweh is with us. Don&rsquo;t fear them.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>But all the congregation threatened to stone them with stones. Yahweh&rsquo;s glory appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel.</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>Yahweh said to Moses, &ldquo;How long will this people despise me? How long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have worked among them?</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>Moses said to Yahweh, &ldquo;Then the Egyptians will hear it; for you brought up this people in your might from among them.</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>They will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you Yahweh are among this people; for you Yahweh are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them, and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>Now if you killed this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying,</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>&lsquo;Because Yahweh was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.&rsquo;</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>Now please let the power of the Lord be great, according as you have spoken, saying,</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>&lsquo;Yahweh is slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, forgiving iniquity and disobedience; and he will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation.&rsquo;</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>Please pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your loving kindness, and just as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>Yahweh said, &ldquo;I have pardoned according to your word;</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>but in very deed&ndash;as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with Yahweh&rsquo;s glory&ndash;</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>because all those men who have seen my glory and my signs, which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not listened to my voice;</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of those who despised me see it.</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him I will bring into the land into which he went. His offspring shall possess it.</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>Since the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley, tomorrow turn and go into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v26">v26</h6>
<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</p>
<h6 id="v27">v27</h6>
<p>&ldquo;How long shall I bear with this evil congregation that complain against me? I have heard the complaints of the children of Israel, which they complain against me.</p>
<h6 id="v28">v28</h6>
<p>Tell them, &lsquo;As I live, says Yahweh, surely as you have spoken in my ears, so I will do to you.</p>
<h6 id="v29">v29</h6>
<p>Your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all who were counted of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have complained against me,</p>
<h6 id="v30">v30</h6>
<p>surely you shall not come into the land concerning which I swore that I would make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.</p>
<h6 id="v31">v31</h6>
<p>But I will bring in your little ones that you said should be captured or killed, and they shall know the land which you have rejected.</p>
<h6 id="v32">v32</h6>
<p>But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.</p>
<h6 id="v33">v33</h6>
<p>Your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your prostitution, until your dead bodies are consumed in the wilderness.</p>
<h6 id="v34">v34</h6>
<p>After the number of the days in which you spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, you will bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you will know my alienation.&rsquo;</p>
<h6 id="v35">v35</h6>
<p>I, Yahweh, have spoken. I will surely do this to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against me. In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v36">v36</h6>
<p>The men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up an evil report against the land,</p>
<h6 id="v37">v37</h6>
<p>even those men who brought up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Yahweh.</p>
<h6 id="v38">v38</h6>
<p>But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land.</p>
<h6 id="v39">v39</h6>
<p>Moses told these words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned greatly.</p>
<h6 id="v40">v40</h6>
<p>They rose up early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, &ldquo;Behold, we are here, and will go up to the place which Yahweh has promised; for we have sinned.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v41">v41</h6>
<p>Moses said, &ldquo;Why now do you disobey the commandment of Yahweh, since it shall not prosper?</p>
<h6 id="v42">v42</h6>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go up, for Yahweh isn&rsquo;t among you; that way you won&rsquo;t be struck down before your enemies.</p>
<h6 id="v43">v43</h6>
<p>For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and you will fall by the sword because you turned back from following Yahweh; therefore Yahweh will not be with you.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v44">v44</h6>
<p>But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain. Nevertheless, the ark of Yahweh&rsquo;s covenant and Moses didn&rsquo;t depart out of the camp.</p>
<h6 id="v45">v45</h6>
<p>Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites who lived in that mountain, and struck them and beat them down even to Hormah.</p>
