as Yahweh spoke to Moses, so the children of Israel did.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>&ldquo;Speak to the children of Israel: &lsquo;When a man or woman commits any sin that men commit, so as to trespass against Yahweh, and that soul is guilty,</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>then he shall confess his sin which he has done; and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, add to it the fifth part of it, and give it to him in respect of whom he has been guilty.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made to Yahweh shall be the priest&rsquo;s, in addition to the ram of the atonement, by which atonement shall be made for him.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Every heave offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they present to the priest, shall be his.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>Every man&rsquo;s holy things shall be his;
