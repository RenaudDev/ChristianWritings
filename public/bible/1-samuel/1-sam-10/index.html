    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>Then Samuel took the vial of oil and poured it on his head, then kissed him and said, &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t Yahweh anointed you to be prince over his inheritance?</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>When you have departed from me today, then you will find two men by Rachel&rsquo;s tomb, on the border of Benjamin at Zelzah. They will tell you, &lsquo;The donkeys which you went to look for have been found; and behold, your father has stopped caring about the donkeys and is anxious for you, saying, &ldquo;What shall I do for my son?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will go on forward from there, and you will come to the oak of Tabor. Three men will meet you there going up to God to Bethel: one carrying three young goats, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a container of wine.</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive from their hand.</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>&ldquo;After that you will come to the hill of God, where the garrison of the Philistines is; and it will happen, when you have come there to the city, that you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a lute, a tambourine, a pipe, and a harp before them; and they will be prophesying.</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>Then Yahweh&rsquo;s Spirit will come mightily on you, then you will prophesy with them and will be turned into another man.</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>Let it be, when these signs have come to you, that you do what is appropriate for the occasion; for God is with you.</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>&ldquo;Go down ahead of me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings. Wait seven days, until I come to you and show you what you are to do.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>It was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart; and all those signs happened that day.</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him, and he prophesied among them.</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>When all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said to one another, &ldquo;What is this that has come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>One from the same place answered, &ldquo;Who is their father?&rdquo; Therefore it became a proverb, &ldquo;Is Saul also among the prophets?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>Saul&rsquo;s uncle said to him and to his servant, &ldquo;Where did you go?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;To seek the donkeys. When we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>Saul&rsquo;s uncle said, &ldquo;Please tell me what Samuel said to you.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>Saul said to his uncle, &ldquo;He told us plainly that the donkeys were found.&rdquo; But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he didn&rsquo;t tell him.</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>and he said to the children of Israel, &ldquo;Yahweh, the God of Israel, says &lsquo;I brought Israel up out of Egypt and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.&rsquo;</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>But you have today rejected your God, who himself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said to him, &lsquo;No! Set a king over us!&rsquo; Now therefore present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes and by your thousands.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families and the family of the Matrites was chosen. Then Saul the son of Kish was chosen; but when they looked for him, he could not be found.</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>Therefore they asked of Yahweh further, &ldquo;Is there yet a man to come here?&rdquo; Yahweh answered, &ldquo;Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>They ran and got him there. When he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>Samuel said to all the people, &ldquo;Do you see him whom Yahweh has chosen, that there is no one like him among all the people?&rdquo; All the people shouted and said, &ldquo;Long live the king!&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>Then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book and laid it up before Yahweh. Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.</p>
<h6 id="v26">v26</h6>
<p>Saul also went to his house in Gibeah; and the army went with him, whose hearts God had touched.</p>
<h6 id="v27">v27</h6>
<p>But certain worthless fellows said, &ldquo;How could this man save us?&rdquo; They despised him, and brought him no tribute. But he held his peace.</p>
