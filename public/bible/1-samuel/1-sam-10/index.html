oil and poured it on his head, then kissed him and said, &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t Yahweh anointed you to be prince over his inheritance?</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>When you have departed from me today, then you will find two men by Rachel&rsquo;s tomb, on the border of Benjamin at Zelzah. They will tell you, &lsquo;The donkeys which you went to look for have been found; and behold, your father has stopped caring about the donkeys and is anxious for you, saying, &ldquo;What shall I do for my son?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>&ldquo;Then you will go on forward from there, and you will come to the oak of Tabor. Three men will meet you there going up to God to Bethel: one carrying three young goats, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a container of wine.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive from their hand.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>&ldquo;After that you will come to the hill of God, where the garrison of the Philistines is; and it will happen, when you have come there to the city, that you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a lute, a tambourine, a pipe, and a harp before them; and they will be prophesying.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>Then Yahweh&rsquo;s Spirit will come mightily on you, then you will prophesy with them and will be turned into another man.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>Let it be, when these signs have come to you, that you do what is appropriate for the occasion; for God is with you.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>&ldquo;Go down ahead of me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings. Wait seven days, until I come to you and show you what you are to do.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>It was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart; and all those signs happened that day.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him, and he prophesied among them.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>When all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said to one another, &ldquo;What is this that has come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>One from the same place answered, &ldquo;Who is their father?&rdquo; Therefore it became a proverb, &ldquo;Is Saul also among the prophets?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Saul&rsquo;s uncle said to him and to his servant, &ldquo;Where did you go?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;To seek the donkeys. When we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Saul&rsquo;s uncle said, &ldquo;Please tell me what Samuel said to you.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>Saul said to his uncle, &ldquo;He told us plainly that the donkeys were found.&rdquo; But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he didn&rsquo;t tell him.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>and he said to the children of Israel, &ldquo;Yahweh, the God of Israel, says &lsquo;I brought Israel up out of Egypt and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>But you have today rejected your God, who himself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said to him, &lsquo;No! Set a king over us!&rsquo; Now therefore present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes and by your thousands.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families and the family of the Matrites was chosen. Then Saul the son of Kish was chosen; but when they looked for him, he could not be found.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>Therefore they asked of Yahweh further, &ldquo;Is there yet a man to come here?&rdquo; Yahweh answered, &ldquo;Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>They ran and got him there. When he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>Samuel said to all the people, &ldquo;Do you see him whom Yahweh has chosen, that there is no one like him among all the people?&rdquo; All the people shouted and said, &ldquo;Long live the king!&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>Then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book and laid it up before Yahweh. Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>Saul also went to his house in Gibeah; and the army went with him, whose hearts God had touched.</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>But certain worthless fellows said, &ldquo;How could this man save us?&rdquo; They despised him, and brought him no tribute. But he held his peace.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/1-samuel/1-sam-09/>1 Samuel 9</a>
