Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, &ldquo;Why are you alone, and no man with you?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>David said to Ahimelech the priest, &ldquo;The king has commanded me to do something, and has said to me, &lsquo;Let no one know anything about the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you. I have sent the young men to a certain place.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>Now therefore what is under your hand? Please give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever is available.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>The priest answered David, and said, &ldquo;I have no common bread, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>David answered the priest, and said to him, &ldquo;Truly, women have been kept from us as usual these three days. When I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was only a common journey. How much more then today shall their vessels be holy?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread that was taken from before Yahweh, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>David said to Ahimelech, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there here under your hand spear or sword? For I haven&rsquo;t brought my sword or my weapons with me, because the king&rsquo;s business required haste.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>The priest said, &ldquo;Behold, the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you would like to take that, take it; for there is no other except that here.&rdquo; David said, &ldquo;There is none like that. Give it to me.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>The servants of Achish said to him, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this David the king of the land? Didn&rsquo;t they sing to one another about him in dances, saying, &lsquo;Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>He changed his behavior before them, and pretended to be insane in their hands, and scribbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Then Achish said to his servants, &ldquo;Look, you see the man is insane. Why then have you brought him to me?</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Should this fellow come into my house?&rdquo;</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/1-samuel/1-sam-20/>1 Samuel 20</a>
