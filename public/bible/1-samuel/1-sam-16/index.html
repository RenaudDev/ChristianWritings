&ldquo;How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided a king for myself among his sons.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>Samuel said, &ldquo;How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.&rdquo; Yahweh said, &ldquo;Take a heifer with you, and say, I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. You shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, &ldquo;Do you come peaceably?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>He said, &ldquo;Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.&rdquo; He sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>When they had come, he looked at Eliab, and said, &ldquo;Surely Yahweh&rsquo;s anointed is before him.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>But Yahweh said to Samuel, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look on his face, or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for I don&rsquo;t see as man sees. For man looks at the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, &ldquo;Yahweh has not chosen this one, either.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. He said, &ldquo;Yahweh has not chosen this one, either.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, &ldquo;Yahweh has not chosen these.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Samuel said to Jesse, &ldquo;Are all your children here?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;There remains yet the youngest. Behold, he is keeping the sheep.&rdquo; Samuel said to Jesse, &ldquo;Send and get him, for we will not sit down until he comes here.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>He sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with a handsome face and good appearance. Yahweh said, &ldquo;Arise! Anoint him, for this is he.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the middle of his brothers. Then Yahweh&rsquo;s Spirit came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Now Yahweh&rsquo;s Spirit departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled him.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Saul&rsquo;s servants said to him, &ldquo;See now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>Let our lord now command your servants who are in front of you to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp. Then when the evil spirit from God is on you, he will play with his hand, and you will be well.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>Saul said to his servants, &ldquo;Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>Then one of the young men answered and said, &ldquo;Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and Yahweh is with him.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, &ldquo;Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a container of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by David his son to Saul.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>David came to Saul and stood before him. He loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>Saul sent to Jesse, saying, &ldquo;Please let David stand before me, for he has found favor in my sight.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>When the spirit from God was on Saul, David took the harp and played with his hand; so Saul was refreshed and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/1-samuel/1-sam-15/>1 Samuel 15</a>
