Yahweh&rsquo;s word was rare in those days. There were not many visions, then.</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>At that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see),</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>and God&rsquo;s lamp hadn&rsquo;t yet gone out, and Samuel had laid down in Yahweh&rsquo;s temple where God&rsquo;s ark was,</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Yahweh called Samuel. He said, &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>He ran to Eli and said, &ldquo;Here I am; for you called me.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t call. Lie down again.&rdquo; He went and lay down.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>Yahweh called yet again, &ldquo;Samuel!&rdquo; Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, &ldquo;Here I am; for you called me.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t call, my son. Lie down again.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>Now Samuel didn&rsquo;t yet know Yahweh, neither was Yahweh&rsquo;s word yet revealed to him.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Yahweh called Samuel again the third time. He arose and went to Eli and said, &ldquo;Here I am; for you called me.&rdquo; Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, &ldquo;Go, lie down. It shall be, if he calls you, that you shall say, &lsquo;Speak, Yahweh; for your servant hears.&rsquo;&rdquo; So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, &ldquo;Samuel! Samuel!&rdquo; Then Samuel said, &ldquo;Speak; for your servant hears.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Yahweh said to Samuel, &ldquo;Behold, I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves, and he didn&rsquo;t restrain them.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli&rsquo;s house shall not be removed with sacrifice or offering forever.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of Yahweh&rsquo;s house. Samuel was afraid to show Eli the vision.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>Then Eli called Samuel and said, &ldquo;Samuel, my son!&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>He said, &ldquo;What is the thing that he has spoken to you? Please don&rsquo;t hide it from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to you.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>Samuel told him every bit, and hid nothing from him. He said, &ldquo;It is Yahweh. Let him do what seems good to him.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>Samuel grew, and Yahweh was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Yahweh.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by Yahweh&rsquo;s word.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/1-samuel/1-sam-02/>1 Samuel 2</a>
