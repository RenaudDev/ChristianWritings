But Jonathan, Saul&rsquo;s son, greatly delighted in David.</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>Jonathan told David, saying, &ldquo;Saul my father seeks to kill you. Now therefore, please take care of yourself in the morning, and live in a secret place, and hide yourself.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will talk with my father about you; and if I see anything, I will tell you.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let the king sin against his servant, against David; because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been very good toward you;</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>for he put his life in his hand, and struck the Philistine, and Yahweh worked a great victory for all Israel. You saw it, and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, &ldquo;As Yahweh lives, he shall not be put to death.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as before.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>There was war again. David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>An evil spirit from Yahweh was on Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul&rsquo;s presence, and he stuck the spear into the wall. David fled, and escaped that night.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Saul sent messengers to David&rsquo;s house, to watch him, and to kill him in the morning. Michal, David&rsquo;s wife, told him, saying, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>So Michal let David down through the window. He went away, fled, and escaped.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats&rsquo; hair at its head, and covered it with clothes.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, &ldquo;He is sick.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, &ldquo;Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>When the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats&rsquo; hair at its head.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>Saul said to Michal, &ldquo;Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?&rdquo; Michal answered Saul, &ldquo;He said to me, &lsquo;Let me go! Why should I kill you?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>Now David fled and escaped, and came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went and lived in Naioth.</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>Saul was told, saying, &ldquo;Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>Saul sent messengers to seize David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, God&rsquo;s Spirit came on Saul&rsquo;s messengers, and they also prophesied.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>When Saul was told, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>Then he also went to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked, &ldquo;Where are Samuel and David?&rdquo; One said, &ldquo;Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>He went there to Naioth in Ramah. Then God&rsquo;s Spirit came on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>He also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, &ldquo;Is Saul also among the prophets?&rdquo;</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/1-samuel/1-sam-18/>1 Samuel 18</a>
