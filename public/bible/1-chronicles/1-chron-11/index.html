The same is David&rsquo;s city.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>David said, &ldquo;Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain.&rdquo; Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it David&rsquo;s city.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>He built the city all around, from Millo even around; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh of Armies was with him.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to Yahweh&rsquo;s word concerning Israel.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>This is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>They stood in the middle of the plot, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh saved them by a great victory.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem at that time.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>David longed, and said, &ldquo;Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>The three broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; but David would not drink any of it, but poured it out to Yahweh,</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>and said, &ldquo;My God forbid me, that I should do this!
