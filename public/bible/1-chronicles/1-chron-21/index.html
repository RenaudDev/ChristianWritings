    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to take a census of Israel.</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, &ldquo;Go, count Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know how many there are.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>Joab said, &ldquo;May Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are. But, my lord the king, aren&rsquo;t they all my lord&rsquo;s servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>Nevertheless the king&rsquo;s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, then came to Jerusalem.</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>Joab gave up the sum of the census of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew a sword; and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew a sword.</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t count Levi and Benjamin among them; for the king&rsquo;s word was abominable to Joab.</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>David said to God, &ldquo;I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>Yahweh spoke to Gad, David&rsquo;s seer, saying,</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>&ldquo;Go and speak to David, saying, &lsquo;Yahweh says, &ldquo;I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>So Gad came to David, and said to him, &ldquo;Yahweh says, &lsquo;Take your choice:</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and Yahweh&rsquo;s angel destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>David said to Gad, &ldquo;I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into Yahweh&rsquo;s hand; for his mercies are very great. Don&rsquo;t let me fall into man&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, &ldquo;It is enough. Now withdraw your hand.&rdquo; Yahweh&rsquo;s angel was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>David lifted up his eyes, and saw Yahweh&rsquo;s angel standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>David said to God, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it I who commanded the people to be counted? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my father&rsquo;s house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>Then Yahweh&rsquo;s angel commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up and raise an altar to Yahweh on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in Yahweh&rsquo;s name.</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>Then David said to Ornan, &ldquo;Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to Yahweh on it. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>Ornan said to David, &ldquo;Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>King David said to Ornan, &ldquo;No; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering that costs me nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place.</p>
<h6 id="v26">v26</h6>
<p>David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering.</p>
<h6 id="v27">v27</h6>
<p>Then Yahweh commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.</p>
<h6 id="v28">v28</h6>
<p>At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</p>
<h6 id="v29">v29</h6>
<p>For Yahweh&rsquo;s tabernacle, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.</p>
<h6 id="v30">v30</h6>
<p>But David couldn&rsquo;t go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of Yahweh&rsquo;s angel.</p>
