also onyx stones, stones to be set, stones for inlaid work, of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>In addition, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, with which to overlay the walls of the houses;</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the things of silver, and for all kinds of work to be made by the hands of artisans.
