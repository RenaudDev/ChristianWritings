says, &lsquo;Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>Pharaoh said, &ldquo;Who is Yahweh, that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go? I don&rsquo;t know Yahweh, and moreover I will not let Israel go.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>They said, &ldquo;The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go three days&rsquo; journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh, our God, lest he fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>The king of Egypt said to them, &ldquo;Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people from their work? Get back to your burdens!&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>Pharaoh said, &ldquo;Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying,</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>&ldquo;You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>You shall require from them the number of the bricks which they made before. You shall not diminish anything of it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, saying, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go and sacrifice to our God.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labor in it. Don&rsquo;t let them pay any attention to lying words.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>The taskmasters of the people went out with their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, &ldquo;This is what Pharaoh says: &lsquo;I will not give you straw.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>The taskmasters were urgent saying, &ldquo;Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was straw!&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>The officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh&rsquo;s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and were asked, &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today, in making brick as before?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, &ldquo;Why do you deal this way with your servants?</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us, &lsquo;Make brick!&rsquo; and behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>But Pharaoh said, &ldquo;You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go and sacrifice to Yahweh.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>Go therefore now, and work; for no straw shall be given to you; yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks!&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble when it was said, &ldquo;You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>They met Moses and Aaron, who stood along the way, as they came out from Pharaoh.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>They said to them, &ldquo;May Yahweh look at you and judge, because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us!&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, &ldquo;Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Why is it that you have sent me?</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people. You have not rescued your people at all!&rdquo;</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/exodus/exod-04/>Exodus 4</a>
