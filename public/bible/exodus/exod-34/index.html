    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>Yahweh said to Moses, &ldquo;Chisel two stone tablets like the first. I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain.</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>No one shall come up with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain. Do not let the flocks or herds graze in front of that mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>He chiseled two tablets of stone like the first; then Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai, as Yahweh had commanded him, and took in his hand two stone tablets.</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>Yahweh descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed Yahweh&rsquo;s name.</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>Yahweh passed by before him, and proclaimed, &ldquo;Yahweh! Yahweh, a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth,</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>keeping loving kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and disobedience and sin; and who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the children&rsquo;s children, on the third and on the fourth generation.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>Moses hurried and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>He said, &ldquo;If now I have found favor in your sight, Lord, please let the Lord go among us, even though this is a stiff-necked people; pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>He said, &ldquo;Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been worked in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of Yahweh; for it is an awesome thing that I do with you.</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>Observe that which I command you today. Behold, I will drive out before you the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>Be careful, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be for a snare among you;</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>but you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and you shall cut down their Asherah poles;</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>for you shall worship no other god; for Yahweh, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, lest they play the prostitute after their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and one call you and you eat of his sacrifice;</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>and you take of their daughters to your sons, and their daughters play the prostitute after their gods, and make your sons play the prostitute after their gods.</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>&ldquo;You shall make no cast idols for yourselves.</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>&ldquo;You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib you came out of Egypt.</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>&ldquo;All that opens the womb is mine; and all your livestock that is male, the firstborn of cow and sheep.</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>You shall redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a lamb. If you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. You shall redeem all the firstborn of your sons. No one shall appear before me empty.</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>&ldquo;Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest: in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>&ldquo;You shall observe the feast of weeks with the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of harvest at the year&rsquo;s end.</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord Yahweh, the God of Israel.</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders; neither shall any man desire your land when you go up to appear before Yahweh, your God, three times in the year.</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread. The sacrifice of the feast of the Passover shall not be left to the morning.</p>
<h6 id="v26">v26</h6>
<p>&ldquo;You shall bring the first of the first fruits of your ground to the house of Yahweh your God. &ldquo;You shall not boil a young goat in its mother&rsquo;s milk.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v27">v27</h6>
<p>Yahweh said to Moses, &ldquo;Write these words; for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v28">v28</h6>
<p>He was there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread, nor drank water. He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.</p>
<h6 id="v29">v29</h6>
<p>When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the covenant in Moses&rsquo; hand, when he came down from the mountain, Moses didn&rsquo;t know that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.</p>
<h6 id="v30">v30</h6>
<p>When Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him.</p>
<h6 id="v31">v31</h6>
<p>Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke to them.</p>
<h6 id="v32">v32</h6>
<p>Afterward all the children of Israel came near, and he gave them all the commandments that Yahweh had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.</p>
<h6 id="v33">v33</h6>
<p>When Moses was done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.</p>
<h6 id="v34">v34</h6>
<p>But when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded.</p>
<h6 id="v35">v35</h6>
<p>The children of Israel saw Moses&rsquo; face, that the skin of Moses&rsquo; face shone; so Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.</p>
