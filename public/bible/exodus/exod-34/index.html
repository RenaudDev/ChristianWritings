Do not let the flocks or herds graze in front of that mountain.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>He chiseled two tablets of stone like the first; then Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai, as Yahweh had commanded him, and took in his hand two stone tablets.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>Yahweh descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed Yahweh&rsquo;s name.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>Yahweh passed by before him, and proclaimed, &ldquo;Yahweh! Yahweh, a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth,</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>keeping loving kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and disobedience and sin; and who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the children&rsquo;s children, on the third and on the fourth generation.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Moses hurried and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>He said, &ldquo;If now I have found favor in your sight, Lord, please let the Lord go among us, even though this is a stiff-necked people; pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>He said, &ldquo;Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been worked in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of Yahweh; for it is an awesome thing that I do with you.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Observe that which I command you today.
