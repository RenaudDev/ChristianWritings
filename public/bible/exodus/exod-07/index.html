Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers. They also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same thing with their enchantments.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>For they each cast down their rods, and they became serpents; but Aaron&rsquo;s rod swallowed up their rods.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart was hardened, and he didn&rsquo;t listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Yahweh said to Moses, &ldquo;Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart is stubborn.
