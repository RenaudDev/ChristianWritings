came into the wilderness of Sinai.</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>When they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mountain.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>Moses went up to God, and Yahweh called to him out of the mountain, saying, &ldquo;This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>&lsquo;You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles&rsquo; wings, and brought you to myself.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples; for all the earth is mine;</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&rsquo; These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Yahweh commanded him.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>All the people answered together, and said, &ldquo;All that Yahweh has spoken we will do.&rdquo; Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Yahweh said to Moses, &ldquo;Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.&rdquo; Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>Yahweh said to Moses, &ldquo;Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>and be ready for the third day; for on the third day Yahweh will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>You shall set bounds to the people all around, saying, &lsquo;Be careful that you don&rsquo;t go up onto the mountain, or touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.&rsquo; When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>He said to the people, &ldquo;Be ready by the third day. Don&rsquo;t have sexual relations with a woman.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>On the third day, when it was morning, there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet; and all the people who were in the camp trembled.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain.</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>All of Mount Sinai smoked, because Yahweh descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly.</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>Yahweh said to Moses, &ldquo;Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to Yahweh to gaze, and many of them perish.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>Let the priests also, who come near to Yahweh, sanctify themselves, lest Yahweh break out on them.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>Moses said to Yahweh, &ldquo;The people can&rsquo;t come up to Mount Sinai, for you warned us, saying, &lsquo;Set bounds around the mountain, and sanctify it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>Yahweh said to him, &ldquo;Go down! You shall bring Aaron up with you, but don&rsquo;t let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh, lest he break out against them.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>So Moses went down to the people, and told them.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/exodus/exod-18/>Exodus 18</a>
