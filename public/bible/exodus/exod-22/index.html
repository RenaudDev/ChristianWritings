    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>&ldquo;If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and kills it or sells it, he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>If the thief is found breaking in, and is struck so that he dies, there shall be no guilt of bloodshed for him.</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>If the sun has risen on him, he is guilty of bloodshed. He shall make restitution. If he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>If the stolen property is found in his hand alive, whether it is ox, donkey, or sheep, he shall pay double.</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>&ldquo;If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten by letting his animal loose, and it grazes in another man&rsquo;s field, he shall make restitution from the best of his own field, and from the best of his own vineyard.</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>&ldquo;If fire breaks out, and catches in thorns so that the shocks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field are consumed; he who kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>&ldquo;If a man delivers to his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it is stolen out of the man&rsquo;s house, if the thief is found, he shall pay double.</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>If the thief isn&rsquo;t found, then the master of the house shall come near to God, to find out whether or not he has put his hand on his neighbor&rsquo;s goods.</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>For every matter of trespass, whether it is for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for clothing, or for any kind of lost thing, about which one says, &lsquo;This is mine,&rsquo; the cause of both parties shall come before God. He whom God condemns shall pay double to his neighbor.</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>&ldquo;If a man delivers to his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal to keep, and it dies or is injured, or driven away, no man seeing it;</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>the oath of Yahweh shall be between them both, he has not put his hand on his neighbor&rsquo;s goods; and its owner shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution.</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>But if it is stolen from him, the one who stole shall make restitution to its owner.</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>If it is torn in pieces, let him bring it for evidence. He shall not make good that which was torn.</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>&ldquo;If a man borrows anything of his neighbor&rsquo;s, and it is injured, or dies, its owner not being with it, he shall surely make restitution.</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>If its owner is with it, he shall not make it good. If it is a leased thing, it came for its lease.</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>&ldquo;If a man entices a virgin who isn&rsquo;t pledged to be married, and lies with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife.</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>If her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not allow a sorceress to live.</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever has sex with an animal shall surely be put to death.</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>&ldquo;He who sacrifices to any god, except to Yahweh only, shall be utterly destroyed.</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not wrong an alien or oppress him, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not take advantage of any widow or fatherless child.</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>If you take advantage of them at all, and they cry at all to me, I will surely hear their cry;</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>and my wrath will grow hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>&ldquo;If you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor, you shall not be to him as a creditor. You shall not charge him interest.</p>
<h6 id="v26">v26</h6>
<p>If you take your neighbor&rsquo;s garment as collateral, you shall restore it to him before the sun goes down,</p>
<h6 id="v27">v27</h6>
<p>for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin. What would he sleep in? It will happen, when he cries to me, that I will hear, for I am gracious.</p>
<h6 id="v28">v28</h6>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not blaspheme God, nor curse a ruler of your people.</p>
<h6 id="v29">v29</h6>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not delay to offer from your harvest and from the outflow of your presses. &ldquo;You shall give the firstborn of your sons to me.</p>
<h6 id="v30">v30</h6>
<p>You shall do likewise with your cattle and with your sheep. It shall be with its mother seven days, then on the eighth day you shall give it to me.</p>
<h6 id="v31">v31</h6>
<p>&ldquo;You shall be holy men to me, therefore you shall not eat any meat that is torn by animals in the field. You shall cast it to the dogs.</p>
