of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, &lsquo;I will give it to your offspring.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>Go to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I will not go up among you, for you are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume you on the way.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>When the people heard this evil news, they mourned; and no one put on his jewelry.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>Yahweh had said to Moses, &ldquo;Tell the children of Israel, &lsquo;You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go up among you for one moment, I would consume you. Therefore now take off your jewelry from you, that I may know what to do to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>The children of Israel stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp, and he called it &ldquo;The Tent of Meeting.&rdquo; Everyone who sought Yahweh went out to the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>When Moses went out to the Tent, all the people rose up, and stood, everyone at their tent door, and watched Moses, until he had gone into the Tent.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>When Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, stood at the door of the Tent, and Yahweh spoke with Moses.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>All the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent, and all the people rose up and worshiped, everyone at their tent door.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. He turned again into the camp, but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, didn&rsquo;t depart from the Tent.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>Moses said to Yahweh, &ldquo;Behold, you tell me, &lsquo;Bring up this people;&rsquo; and you haven&rsquo;t let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, &lsquo;I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me your way, now, that I may know you, so that I may find favor in your sight; and consider that this nation is your people.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>He said, &ldquo;My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Moses said to him, &ldquo;If your presence doesn&rsquo;t go with me, don&rsquo;t carry us up from here.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>For how would people know that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people?
