    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Yahweh, and said, &ldquo;I will sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously. He has thrown the horse and his rider into the sea.</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>Yah is my strength and song. He has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will praise him; my father&rsquo;s God, and I will exalt him.</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>Yahweh is a man of war. Yahweh is his name.</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>He has cast Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariots and his army into the sea. His chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>The deeps cover them. They went down into the depths like a stone.</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>Your right hand, Yahweh, is glorious in power. Your right hand, Yahweh, dashes the enemy in pieces.</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>In the greatness of your excellency, you overthrow those who rise up against you. You send out your wrath. It consumes them as stubble.</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>With the blast of your nostrils, the waters were piled up. The floods stood upright as a heap. The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>The enemy said, &lsquo;I will pursue. I will overtake. I will divide the plunder. My desire will be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword. My hand will destroy them.&rsquo;</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>You blew with your wind. The sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>Who is like you, Yahweh, among the gods? Who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>You stretched out your right hand. The earth swallowed them.</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>&ldquo;You, in your loving kindness, have led the people that you have redeemed. You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>The peoples have heard. They tremble. Pangs have taken hold of the inhabitants of Philistia.</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed. Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab. All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>Terror and dread falls on them. By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone, until your people pass over, Yahweh, until the people you have purchased pass over.</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>You will bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, the place, Yahweh, which you have made for yourself to dwell in; the sanctuary, Lord, which your hands have established.</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>Yahweh will reign forever and ever.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Yahweh brought back the waters of the sea on them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the middle of the sea.</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>Miriam answered them, &ldquo;Sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously. He has thrown the horse and his rider into the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>When they came to Marah, they couldn&rsquo;t drink from the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore its name was called Marah.</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>The people murmured against Moses, saying, &ldquo;What shall we drink?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>Then he cried to Yahweh. Yahweh showed him a tree, and he threw it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there he tested them.</p>
<h6 id="v26">v26</h6>
<p>He said, &ldquo;If you will diligently listen to Yahweh your God&rsquo;s voice, and will do that which is right in his eyes, and will pay attention to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have put on the Egyptians; for I am Yahweh who heals you.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v27">v27</h6>
<p>They came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees. They encamped there by the waters.</p>
