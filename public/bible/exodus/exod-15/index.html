for he has triumphed gloriously. He has thrown the horse and his rider into the sea.</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>Yah is my strength and song. He has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will praise him; my father&rsquo;s God, and I will exalt him.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>Yahweh is a man of war. Yahweh is his name.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>He has cast Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariots and his army into the sea. His chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>The deeps cover them. They went down into the depths like a stone.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>Your right hand, Yahweh, is glorious in power. Your right hand, Yahweh, dashes the enemy in pieces.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>In the greatness of your excellency, you overthrow those who rise up against you. You send out your wrath. It consumes them as stubble.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>With the blast of your nostrils, the waters were piled up. The floods stood upright as a heap. The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>The enemy said, &lsquo;I will pursue. I will overtake. I will divide the plunder. My desire will be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword. My hand will destroy them.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>You blew with your wind. The sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Who is like you, Yahweh, among the gods? Who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>You stretched out your right hand. The earth swallowed them.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>&ldquo;You, in your loving kindness, have led the people that you have redeemed. You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>The peoples have heard. They tremble. Pangs have taken hold of the inhabitants of Philistia.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed. Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab. All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>Terror and dread falls on them. By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone, until your people pass over, Yahweh, until the people you have purchased pass over.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>You will bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, the place, Yahweh, which you have made for yourself to dwell in; the sanctuary, Lord, which your hands have established.</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>Yahweh will reign forever and ever.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Yahweh brought back the waters of the sea on them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the middle of the sea.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>Miriam answered them, &ldquo;Sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously. He has thrown the horse and his rider into the sea.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>When they came to Marah, they couldn&rsquo;t drink from the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore its name was called Marah.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>The people murmured against Moses, saying, &ldquo;What shall we drink?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>Then he cried to Yahweh. Yahweh showed him a tree, and he threw it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there he tested them.</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>He said, &ldquo;If you will diligently listen to Yahweh your God&rsquo;s voice, and will do that which is right in his eyes, and will pay attention to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have put on the Egyptians; for I am Yahweh who heals you.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>They came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees. They encamped there by the waters.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/exodus/exod-14/>Exodus 14</a>
