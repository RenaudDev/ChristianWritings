for they commit falsehood, and the thief enters in, and the gang of robbers ravages outside.</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>They don&rsquo;t consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness. Now their own deeds have engulfed them. They are before my face.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>They are all adulterers. They are burning like an oven that the baker stops stirring, from the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>On the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine. He joined his hand with mockers.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>For they have prepared their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait. Their baker sleeps all the night. In the morning it burns as a flaming fire.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges. All their kings have fallen. There is no one among them who calls to me.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Ephraim, he mixes himself among the nations. Ephraim is a pancake not turned over.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Strangers have devoured his strength, and he doesn&rsquo;t realize it. Indeed, gray hairs are here and there on him, and he doesn&rsquo;t realize it.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>The pride of Israel testifies to his face; yet they haven&rsquo;t returned to Yahweh their God, nor sought him, for all this.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>&ldquo;Ephraim is like an easily deceived dove, without understanding. They call to Egypt. They go to Assyria.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>When they go, I will spread my net on them. I will bring them down like the birds of the sky. I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>Woe to them! For they have wandered from me. Destruction to them! For they have trespassed against me. Though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>They haven&rsquo;t cried to me with their heart, but they howl on their beds. They assemble themselves for grain and new wine. They turn away from me.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet they plot evil against me.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>They return, but not to the Most High. They are like a faulty bow. Their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue. This will be their derision in the land of Egypt.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/hosea/hos-06/>Hosea 6</a>
