Or will you bind him for your girls?</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>Will traders barter for him? Will they part him among the merchants?</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>Can you fill his skin with barbed irons, or his head with fish spears?</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Lay your hand on him. Remember the battle, and do so no more.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Behold, the hope of him is in vain.
