them to present himself before Yahweh.</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>Yahweh said to Satan, &ldquo;Where have you come from?&rdquo; Satan answered Yahweh, and said, &ldquo;From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>Yahweh said to Satan, &ldquo;Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Satan answered Yahweh, and said, &ldquo;Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>But stretch out your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>Yahweh said to Satan, &ldquo;Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Then his wife said to him, &ldquo;Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>But he said to her, &ldquo;You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?&rdquo; In all this Job didn&rsquo;t sin with his lips.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Now when Job&rsquo;s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn&rsquo;t recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/job/job-01/>Job 1</a>
