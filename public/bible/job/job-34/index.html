Give ear to me, you who have knowledge.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>For the ear tries words, as the palate tastes food.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Let us choose for us that which is right. Let us know among ourselves what is good.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>For Job has said, &lsquo;I am righteous, God has taken away my right:</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar. My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water,</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men?</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>For he has said, &lsquo;It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>&ldquo;Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>For the work of a man he will render to him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>Yes surely, God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert justice.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>Who put him in charge of the earth? Or who has appointed him over the whole world?</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>If he set his heart on himself, if he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath,</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>all flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>&ldquo;If now you have understanding, hear this. Listen to the voice of my words.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>Should even one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty?&ndash;</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>Who says to a king, &lsquo;Vile!&rsquo; or to nobles, &lsquo;Wicked!&rsquo;?</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>He doesn&rsquo;t respect the persons of princes, nor respect the rich more than the poor; for they all are the work of his hands.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>In a moment they die, even at midnight. The people are shaken and pass away. The mighty are taken away without a hand.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>&ldquo;For his eyes are on the ways of a man. He sees all his goings.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>For he doesn&rsquo;t need to consider a man further, that he should go before God in judgment.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>He breaks mighty men in pieces in ways past finding out, and sets others in their place.</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>Therefore he takes knowledge of their works. He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>because they turned away from following him, and wouldn&rsquo;t pay attention to any of his ways,</p><h6 id=v28>v28</h6><p>so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him. He heard the cry of the afflicted.</p><h6 id=v29>v29</h6><p>When he gives quietness, who then can condemn? When he hides his face, who then can see him? He is over a nation or a man alike,</p><h6 id=v30>v30</h6><p>that the godless man may not reign, that there be no one to ensnare the people.</p><h6 id=v31>v31</h6><p>&ldquo;For has any said to God, &lsquo;I am guilty, but I will not offend any more.</p><h6 id=v32>v32</h6><p>Teach me that which I don&rsquo;t see. If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more&rsquo;?</p><h6 id=v33>v33</h6><p>Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it? For you must choose, and not I. Therefore speak what you know.</p><h6 id=v34>v34</h6><p>Men of understanding will tell me, yes, every wise man who hears me:</p><h6 id=v35>v35</h6><p>&lsquo;Job speaks without knowledge. His words are without wisdom.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v36>v36</h6><p>I wish that Job were tried to the end, because of his answering like wicked men.</p><h6 id=v37>v37</h6><p>For he adds rebellion to his sin. He claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against God.&rdquo;</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/job/job-33/>Job 33</a>
