Yes, your own lips testify against you.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>&ldquo;Are you the first man who was born? Or were you brought out before the hills?</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Have you heard the secret counsel of God? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>What do you know that we don&rsquo;t know?

Why do your eyes flash,</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>that you turn your spirit against God, and let such words go out of your mouth?</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>What is man, that he should be clean? What is he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones. Yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight;</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks iniquity like water!</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>&ldquo;I will show you, listen to me; that which I have seen I will declare</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>(which wise men have told by their fathers, and have not hidden it;</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them):</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>the wicked man writhes in pain all his days, even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>A sound of terrors is in his ears.
