Blow the trumpet in Tekoa and raise up a signal on Beth Haccherem, for evil looks out from the north with a great destruction.</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>I will cut off the beautiful and delicate one, the daughter of Zion.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>Shepherds with their flocks will come to her. They will pitch their tents against her all around. They will feed everyone in his place.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>&ldquo;Prepare war against her! Arise! Let&rsquo;s go up at noon. Woe to us! For the day declines, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>Arise! Let&rsquo;s go up by night, and let&rsquo;s destroy her palaces.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>For Yahweh of Armies said, &ldquo;Cut down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem. This is the city to be visited. She is wholly oppression within herself.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>As a well produces its waters, so she produces her wickedness. Violence and destruction is heard in her. Sickness and wounds are continually before me.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Be instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from you, lest I make you a desolation, an uninhabited land.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Yahweh of Armies says, &ldquo;They will thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel like a vine. Turn again your hand as a grape gatherer into the baskets.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>To whom should I speak and testify, that they may hear? Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they can&rsquo;t listen. Behold, Yahweh&rsquo;s word has become a reproach to them. They have no delight in it.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>Therefore I am full of Yahweh&rsquo;s wrath. I am weary with holding it in. &ldquo;Pour it out on the children in the street, and on the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife will be taken, the aged with him who is full of days.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>Their houses will be turned to others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land, says Yahweh.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>&ldquo;For from their least even to their greatest, everyone is given to covetousness. From the prophet even to the priest, everyone deals falsely.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>They have healed also the hurt of my people superficially, saying, &lsquo;Peace, peace!&rsquo; when there is no peace.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush. Therefore they will fall among those who fall. When I visit them, they will be cast down,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>Yahweh says, &ldquo;Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, &lsquo;Where is the good way?&rsquo; and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. But they said, &lsquo;We will not walk in it.&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>I set watchmen over you, saying, &lsquo;Listen to the sound of the trumpet!&rsquo; But they said, &lsquo;We will not listen!&rsquo;</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>Therefore hear, you nations, and know, congregation, what is among them.</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>Hear, earth! Behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>To what purpose does frankincense from Sheba come to me, and the sweet cane from a far country? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, and your sacrifices are not pleasing to me.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>Therefore Yahweh says, &ldquo;Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people. The fathers and the sons together will stumble against them. The neighbor and his friend will perish.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>Yahweh says, &ldquo;Behold, a people comes from the north country. A great nation will be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>They take hold of bow and spear. They are cruel, and have no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, daughter of Zion.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>We have heard its report. Our hands become feeble. Anguish has taken hold of us, and pains as of a woman in labor.</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>Don&rsquo;t go out into the field or walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and terror are on every side.</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>Daughter of my people, clothe yourself with sackcloth, and wallow in ashes! Mourn, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation, for the destroyer will suddenly come on us.</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>&ldquo;I have made you a tester of metals and a fortress among my people, that you may know and try their way.</p><h6 id=v28>v28</h6><p>They are all grievous rebels, going around to slander. They are bronze and iron. All of them deal corruptly.</p><h6 id=v29>v29</h6><p>The bellows blow fiercely. The lead is consumed in the fire. In vain they go on refining, for the wicked are not plucked away.</p><h6 id=v30>v30</h6><p>Men will call them rejected silver, because Yahweh has rejected them.&rdquo;</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/jeremiah/jer-05/>Jeremiah 5</a>
