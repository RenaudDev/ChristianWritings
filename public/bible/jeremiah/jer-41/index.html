and there they ate bread together in Mizpah.</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>The second day after he had killed Gedaliah, and no man knew it,</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, having their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with meal offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to Yahweh&rsquo;s house.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and as he met them, he said to them, &ldquo;Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>It was so, when they came into the middle of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, and cast them into the middle of the pit, he, and the men who were with him.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>But ten men were found among those who said to Ishmael, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill us; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey.&rdquo; So he stopped, and didn&rsquo;t kill them among their brothers.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had killed, by the side of Gedaliah (this was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were killed.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>Then Ishmael carried away captive all of the people who were left in Mizpah, even the king&rsquo;s daughters, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
