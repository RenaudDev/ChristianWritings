<h6 id="v28">v28</h6>
<p>and Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, even to great Sidon.</p>
<h6 id="v29">v29</h6>
<p>The border turned to Ramah, to the fortified city of Tyre; and the border turned to Hosah. It ended at the sea by the region of Achzib;</p>
<h6 id="v30">v30</h6>

<h6 id="v40">v40</h6>

<p>Me Jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border opposite Joppa.</p>
<h6 id="v47">v47</h6>
<p>The border of the children of Dan went out beyond them; for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and lived therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their forefather.</p>
<h6 id="v48">v48</h6>
<p>This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.</p>

<h6 id="v51">v51</h6>
<p>These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers&rsquo; houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Yahweh, at the door of the Tent of Meeting. So they finished dividing the land.</p>
