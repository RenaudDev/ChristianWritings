She didn&rsquo;t receive correction. She didn&rsquo;t trust in Yahweh. She didn&rsquo;t draw near to her God.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>Her princes within her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves. They leave nothing until the next day.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the law.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>Yahweh, within her, is righteous. He will do no wrong. Every morning he brings his justice to light. He doesn&rsquo;t fail, but the unjust know no shame.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>I have cut off nations. Their battlements are desolate. I have made their streets waste, so that no one passes by. Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>I said, &ldquo;Just fear me. Receive correction, so that her dwelling won&rsquo;t be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her.&rdquo; But they rose early and corrupted all their doings.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>&ldquo;Therefore wait for me&rdquo;, says Yahweh, &ldquo;until the day that I rise up to the prey, for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour on them my indignation, even all my fierce anger, for all the earth will be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>For then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that they may all call on Yahweh&rsquo;s name, to serve him shoulder to shoulder.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>From beyond the rivers of Cush, my worshipers, even the daughter of my dispersed people, will bring my offering.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>In that day you will not be disappointed for all your doings, in which you have transgressed against me; for then I will take away out from among you your proudly exulting ones, and you will no more be arrogant in my holy mountain.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>But I will leave among you an afflicted and poor people, and they will take refuge in Yahweh&rsquo;s name.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>The remnant of Israel will not do iniquity, nor speak lies, neither will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth, for they will feed and lie down, and no one will make them afraid.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Sing, daughter of Zion! Shout, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Yahweh has taken away your judgments. He has thrown out your enemy. The King of Israel, Yahweh, is among you. You will not be afraid of evil any more.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Zion. Don&rsquo;t let your hands be weak.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>Yahweh, your God, is among you, a mighty one who will save. He will rejoice over you with joy. He will calm you in his love. He will rejoice over you with singing.</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>I will remove those who grieve about the appointed feasts from you. They are a burden and a reproach to you.</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>Behold, at that time I will deal with all those who afflict you, and I will save those who are lame, and gather those who were driven away. I will give them praise and honor, whose shame has been in all the earth.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>At that time I will bring you in, and at that time I will gather you; for I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says Yahweh.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/zephaniah/zeph-02/>Zephaniah 2</a></div></div><footer><article>Copyright © 2021-2022 by Renaud Gagne</article></footer></main></body></html>
