<h6 id="v69">v69</h6>
<p>They gave according to their ability into the treasury of the work sixty-one thousand darics of gold, and five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priests&rsquo; garments.</p>
<h6 id="v70">v70</h6>
<p>So the priests and the Levites, with some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants, lived in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.</p>
