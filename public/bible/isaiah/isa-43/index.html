When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned, and flame will not scorch you.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>For I am Yahweh your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I have given Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in your place.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Since you have been precious and honored in my sight, and I have loved you, therefore I will give people in your place, and nations instead of your life.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid, for I am with you. I will bring your offspring from the east, and gather you from the west.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>I will tell the north, &lsquo;Give them up!&rsquo; and tell the south, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t hold them back!

I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>The animals of the field, the jackals and the ostriches, shall honor me, because I give water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen,</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>the people which I formed for myself, that they might declare my praise.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>Yet you have not called on me, Jacob; but you have been weary of me, Israel.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>You have not brought me any of your sheep for burnt offerings, neither have you honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with offerings, nor wearied you with frankincense.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>You have bought me no sweet cane with money, nor have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices, but you have burdened me with your sins. You have wearied me with your iniquities.</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake; and I will not remember your sins.</p><h6 id=v26>v26</h6><p>Put me in remembrance.

Declare your case, that you may be justified.</p><h6 id=v27>v27</h6><p>Your first father sinned, and your teachers have transgressed against me.</p><h6 id=v28>v28</h6><p>Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary; and I will make Jacob a curse, and Israel an insult.&rdquo;</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/isaiah/isa-42/>Isaiah 42</a>
