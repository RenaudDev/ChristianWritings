I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do this thing that he has spoken.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Behold, I will cause the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down on the sundial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo; So the sun returned ten steps on the sundial on which it had gone down.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered of his sickness.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>I said, &ldquo;In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol.
