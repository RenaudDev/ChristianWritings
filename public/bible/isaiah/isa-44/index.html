    <h6 id="v1">v1</h6>
<p>Yet listen now, Jacob my servant, and Israel, whom I have chosen.</p>
<h6 id="v2">v2</h6>
<p>This is what Yahweh who made you, and formed you from the womb, who will help you says: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Jacob my servant; and you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.</p>
<h6 id="v3">v3</h6>
<p>For I will pour water on him who is thirsty, and streams on the dry ground. I will pour my Spirit on your descendants, and my blessing on your offspring:</p>
<h6 id="v4">v4</h6>
<p>and they will spring up among the grass, as willows by the watercourses.</p>
<h6 id="v5">v5</h6>
<p>One will say, &lsquo;I am Yahweh&rsquo;s;&rsquo; and another will be called by the name of Jacob; and another will write with his hand &rsquo;to Yahweh,&rsquo; and honor the name of Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v6">v6</h6>
<p>This is what Yahweh, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Yahweh of Armies, says: &ldquo;I am the first, and I am the last; and besides me there is no God.</p>
<h6 id="v7">v7</h6>
<p>Who is like me? Who will call, and will declare it, and set it in order for me, since I established the ancient people? Let them declare the things that are coming, and that will happen.</p>
<h6 id="v8">v8</h6>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fear, neither be afraid. Haven&rsquo;t I declared it to you long ago, and shown it? You are my witnesses. Is there a God besides me? Indeed, there is not. I don&rsquo;t know any other Rock.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v9">v9</h6>
<p>Everyone who makes a carved image is vain. The things that they delight in will not profit. Their own witnesses don&rsquo;t see, nor know, that they may be disappointed.</p>
<h6 id="v10">v10</h6>
<p>Who has fashioned a god, or molds an image that is profitable for nothing?</p>
<h6 id="v11">v11</h6>
<p>Behold, all his fellows will be disappointed; and the workmen are mere men. Let them all be gathered together. Let them stand up. They will fear. They will be put to shame together.</p>
<h6 id="v12">v12</h6>
<p>The blacksmith takes an ax, works in the coals, fashions it with hammers, and works it with his strong arm. He is hungry, and his strength fails; he drinks no water, and is faint.</p>
<h6 id="v13">v13</h6>
<p>The carpenter stretches out a line. He marks it out with a pencil. He shapes it with planes. He marks it out with compasses, and shapes it like the figure of a man, with the beauty of a man, to reside in a house.</p>
<h6 id="v14">v14</h6>
<p>He cuts down cedars for himself, and takes the cypress and the oak, and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest. He plants a cypress tree, and the rain nourishes it.</p>
<h6 id="v15">v15</h6>
<p>Then it will be for a man to burn; and he takes some of it, and warms himself. Yes, he burns it, and bakes bread. Yes, he makes a god, and worships it; he makes it a carved image, and falls down to it.</p>
<h6 id="v16">v16</h6>
<p>He burns part of it in the fire. With part of it, he eats meat. He roasts a roast, and is satisfied. Yes, he warms himself, and says, &ldquo;Aha! I am warm. I have seen the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v17">v17</h6>
<p>The rest of it he makes into a god, even his engraved image. He bows down to it and worships, and prays to it, and says, &ldquo;Deliver me; for you are my god!&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v18">v18</h6>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know, neither do they consider: for he has shut their eyes, that they can&rsquo;t see; and their hearts, that they can&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<h6 id="v19">v19</h6>
<p>No one thinks, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, &ldquo;I have burned part of it in the fire. Yes, I have also baked bread on its coals. I have roasted meat and eaten it. Shall I make the rest of it into an abomination? Shall I bow down to a tree trunk?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v20">v20</h6>
<p>He feeds on ashes. A deceived heart has turned him aside; and he can&rsquo;t deliver his soul, nor say, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a lie in my right hand?&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="v21">v21</h6>
<p>Remember these things, Jacob and Israel; for you are my servant. I have formed you. You are my servant. Israel, you will not be forgotten by me.</p>
<h6 id="v22">v22</h6>
<p>I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions, and, as a cloud, your sins. Return to me, for I have redeemed you.</p>
<h6 id="v23">v23</h6>
<p>Sing, you heavens, for Yahweh has done it! Shout, you lower parts of the earth! Break out into singing, you mountains, O forest, all of your trees, for Yahweh has redeemed Jacob, and will glorify himself in Israel.</p>
<h6 id="v24">v24</h6>
<p>Yahweh, your Redeemer, and he who formed you from the womb says: &ldquo;I am Yahweh, who makes all things; who alone stretches out the heavens; who spreads out the earth by myself;</p>
<h6 id="v25">v25</h6>
<p>who frustrates the signs of the liars, and makes diviners mad; who turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;</p>
<h6 id="v26">v26</h6>
<p>who confirms the word of his servant, and performs the counsel of his messengers; who says of Jerusalem, &lsquo;She will be inhabited;&rsquo; and of the cities of Judah, &lsquo;They will be built,&rsquo; and &lsquo;I will raise up its waste places;&rsquo;</p>
<h6 id="v27">v27</h6>
<p>who says to the deep, &lsquo;Be dry,&rsquo; and &lsquo;I will dry up your rivers;&rsquo;</p>
<h6 id="v28">v28</h6>
<p>Who says of Cyrus, &lsquo;He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure,&rsquo; even saying of Jerusalem, &lsquo;She will be built;&rsquo; and of the temple, &lsquo;Your foundation will be laid.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
