I am found by those who didn&rsquo;t seek me. I said, &lsquo;See me, see me,&rsquo; to a nation that was not called by my name.</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>I have spread out my hands all day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense on bricks;</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>who sit among the graves, and spend nights in secret places; who eat pig&rsquo;s meat, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>who say, &lsquo;Stay by yourself, don&rsquo;t come near to me, for I am holier than you.&rsquo; These are smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all day.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>&ldquo;Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will repay, yes, I will repay into their bosom,</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together&rdquo;, says Yahweh, &ldquo;who have burned incense on the mountains, and blasphemed me on the hills. Therefore I will first measure their work into their bosom.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>Yahweh says, &ldquo;As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t destroy it, for a blessing is in it:&rsquo; so I will do for my servants&rsquo; sake, that I may not destroy them all.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>I will bring offspring out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains. My chosen will inherit it, and my servants will dwell there.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>Sharon will be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people who have sought me.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>&ldquo;But you who forsake Yahweh, who forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who fill up mixed wine to Destiny;</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>I will destine you to the sword, and you will all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, you didn&rsquo;t answer. When I spoke, you didn&rsquo;t listen; but you did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I didn&rsquo;t delight.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>Therefore the Lord Yahweh says, &ldquo;Behold, my servants will eat, but you will be hungry; behold, my servants will drink, but you will be thirsty. Behold, my servants will rejoice, but you will be disappointed;</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Behold, my servants will sing for joy of heart, but you will cry for sorrow of heart, and will wail for anguish of spirit.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>You will leave your name for a curse to my chosen; and the Lord Yahweh will kill you. He will call his servants by another name,</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>so that he who blesses himself in the earth will bless himself in the God of truth; and he who swears in the earth will swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hidden from my eyes.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>&ldquo;For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things will not be remembered, nor come into mind.</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem to be a delight, and her people a joy.</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and delight in my people; and the voice of weeping and the voice of crying will be heard in her no more.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>&ldquo;No more will there be an infant who only lives a few days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; for the child will die one hundred years old, and the sinner being one hundred years old will be accursed.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>They will build houses and inhabit them. They will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>They will not build and another inhabit. They will not plant and another eat: for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree, and my chosen will long enjoy the work of their hands.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>They will not labor in vain nor give birth for calamity; for they are the offspring of Yahweh&rsquo;s blessed and their descendants with them.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>It will happen that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>The wolf and the lamb will feed together. The lion will eat straw like the ox. Dust will be the serpent&rsquo;s food. They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/isaiah/isa-64/>Isaiah 64</a>
