The idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence; and the heart of Egypt will melt within it.</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians, and they will fight everyone against his brother, and everyone against his neighbor; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>The spirit of the Egyptians will fail within them. I will destroy their counsel. They will seek the idols, the charmers, those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord. A fierce king will rule over them,&rdquo; says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>The waters will fail from the sea, and the river will be wasted and become dry.</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>The rivers will become foul. The streams of Egypt will be diminished and dried up. The reeds and flags will wither away.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile, will become dry, be driven away, and be no more.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>The fishermen will lament, and all those who fish in the Nile will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will languish.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>Moreover those who work in combed flax, and those who weave white cloth, will be confounded.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>The pillars will be broken in pieces. All those who work for hire will be grieved in soul.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish. The counsel of the wisest counselors of Pharaoh has become stupid. How do you say to Pharaoh, &ldquo;I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>Where then are your wise men? Let them tell you now; and let them know what Yahweh of Armies has purposed concerning Egypt.</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>The princes of Zoan have become fools. The princes of Memphis are deceived. They have caused Egypt to go astray, who are the cornerstone of her tribes.</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the middle of her; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works, like a drunken man staggers in his vomit.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which head or tail, palm branch or rush, may do.</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>In that day the Egyptians will be like women. They will tremble and fear because of the shaking of Yahweh of Armies&rsquo;s hand, which he shakes over them.</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt. Everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid, because of the plans of Yahweh of Armies, which he determines against it.</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>In that day, there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Yahweh of Armies. One will be called &ldquo;The city of destruction.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>In that day, there will be an altar to Yahweh in the middle of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Yahweh at its border.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>It will be for a sign and for a witness to Yahweh of Armies in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to Yahweh because of oppressors, and he will send them a savior and a defender, and he will deliver them.</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>Yahweh will be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know Yahweh in that day. Yes, they will worship with sacrifice and offering, and will vow a vow to Yahweh, and will perform it.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>Yahweh will strike Egypt, striking and healing. They will return to Yahweh, and he will be entreated by them, and will heal them.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>In that day, Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing within the earth;</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>because Yahweh of Armies has blessed them, saying, &ldquo;Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.&rdquo;</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/isaiah/isa-18/>Isaiah 18</a>
