What ails you now, that you have all gone up to the housetops?</p><h6 id=v2>v2</h6><p>You that are full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; your slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle.</p><h6 id=v3>v3</h6><p>All your rulers fled away together. They were bound by the archers. All who were found by you were bound together. They fled far away.</p><h6 id=v4>v4</h6><p>Therefore I said, &ldquo;Look away from me. I will weep bitterly. Don&rsquo;t labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p><h6 id=v5>v5</h6><p>For it is a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity, from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, in the valley of vision, a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v6>v6</h6><p>Elam carried his quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield.</p><h6 id=v7>v7</h6><p>Your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.</p><h6 id=v8>v8</h6><p>He took away the covering of Judah; and you looked in that day to the armor in the house of the forest.</p><h6 id=v9>v9</h6><p>You saw the breaches of David&rsquo;s city, that they were many; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool.</p><h6 id=v10>v10</h6><p>You counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall.</p><h6 id=v11>v11</h6><p>You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you didn&rsquo;t look to him who had done this, neither did you have respect for him who planned it long ago.</p><h6 id=v12>v12</h6><p>In that day, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, called to weeping, to mourning, to baldness, and to dressing in sackcloth;</p><h6 id=v13>v13</h6><p>and behold, joy and gladness, killing cattle and killing sheep, eating meat and drinking wine: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v14>v14</h6><p>Yahweh of Armies revealed himself in my ears, &ldquo;Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die,&rdquo; says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.</p><h6 id=v15>v15</h6><p>The Lord, Yahweh of Armies says, &ldquo;Go, get yourself to this treasurer, even to Shebna, who is over the house, and say,</p><h6 id=v16>v16</h6><p>&lsquo;What are you doing here? Who has you here, that you have dug out a tomb here?&rsquo; Cutting himself out a tomb on high, chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock!&rdquo;</p><h6 id=v17>v17</h6><p>Behold, Yahweh will overcome you and hurl you away violently. Yes, he will grasp you firmly.</p><h6 id=v18>v18</h6><p>He will surely wind you around and around, and throw you like a ball into a large country. There you will die, and there the chariots of your glory will be, you disgrace of your lord&rsquo;s house.</p><h6 id=v19>v19</h6><p>I will thrust you from your office. You will be pulled down from your station.</p><h6 id=v20>v20</h6><p>It will happen in that day that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,</p><h6 id=v21>v21</h6><p>and I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him with your belt. I will commit your government into his hand; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.</p><h6 id=v22>v22</h6><p>I will lay the key of David&rsquo;s house on his shoulder. He will open, and no one will shut. He will shut, and no one will open.</p><h6 id=v23>v23</h6><p>I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place. He will be for a throne of glory to his father&rsquo;s house.</p><h6 id=v24>v24</h6><p>They will hang on him all the glory of his father&rsquo;s house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the pitchers.</p><h6 id=v25>v25</h6><p>&ldquo;In that day,&rdquo; says Yahweh of Armies, &ldquo;the nail that was fastened in a sure place will give way. It will be cut down and fall. The burden that was on it will be cut off, for Yahweh has spoken it.&rdquo;</p></article><hr><div class=content-margin><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/bible/isaiah/isa-21/>Isaiah 21</a>
